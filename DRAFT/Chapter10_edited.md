# Chapter 10: The Confrontation

The project review chamber occupied the heart of the station's administrative level, its circular design reminiscent of corporate boardrooms in Celestia Haven. Holographic displays lined the walls, currently showing the modulation field's real-time effects on surrounding ocean currents. The central table, an oval of polished recycled materials, seated twenty, with Victor Reeves positioned at its head.

Mira entered precisely at 0800, maintaining the professional demeanor expected of Dr. Marina Voss, oceanographic consultant. She nodded to several staff members she'd met during her first days at the station, noting the tension evident in their postures. Word of Victor's accelerated timeline had clearly spread.

Elian arrived moments later, his expression carefully neutral as he took his place opposite his father. Their eyes met briefly across the room, a silent confirmation of their strategy. The data he'd transferred to her quarters terminal the previous night had confirmed their worst fears about the boundary instabilities.

"Let's begin," Victor announced once all participants were seated. "As you know, Project Watershed has reached a critical milestone. The North Pacific station has demonstrated consistent performance within operational parameters for six consecutive months."

Holographic displays shifted to show performance metrics, all carefully curated to support Victor's narrative of success. Mira noted the absence of boundary stability data among the highlighted statistics.

"Based on these results, the Haven Board of Directors has approved accelerated implementation of the Atlantic installation." Victor's voice carried the confidence of someone accustomed to having his declarations accepted without question. "Construction begins in three weeks, with operational status projected within two months."

Murmurs rippled around the table, surprise from some, concern from others. Dr. Chen, the operations director, leaned forward. "Sir, the integration testing protocols require at least six weeks of calibration before network synchronization can begin."

"The protocols have been modified," Victor replied dismissively. "Our engineers have developed a streamlined approach that will allow for concurrent calibration and integration."

"With respect, Mr. Reeves," Dr. Nakamura interjected, "concurrent processes increase the risk of systemic instabilities. The modulation field is sensitive to..."

"The decision has been made, Doctor." Victor's tone hardened slightly. "Haven leadership recognizes the urgency of expanding Project Watershed's benefits to the Atlantic region. Technical concerns will be addressed within the accelerated timeline."

Mira watched the exchange with interest, noting how quickly Victor shut down legitimate scientific objections. His leadership style left no room for dissent, even from his senior technical staff.

Elian met her gaze, his chin dipping just enough to signal her. Time for their planned intervention.

"Mr. Reeves," Mira said, her voice carrying the measured authority of Dr. Voss's academic credentials. "My preliminary analysis of the environmental data suggests caution might be warranted before network expansion."

Victor's gaze shifted to her, his expression cooling. "Dr. Voss. Your consultation was requested for environmental impact assessment, not implementation timelines."

"The two are connected," Mira replied evenly. "The boundary oscillation patterns show concerning trends that could have significant environmental implications, particularly in a networked configuration."

"Boundary oscillations are a known phenomenon, well within manageable parameters," Victor dismissed. "Dr. Chen's team has implemented compensation algorithms specifically designed to address them."

"The algorithms address symptom, not cause," Elian interjected, activating his own display. "Dr. Voss's observations align with concerns I've been documenting for months. The oscillations are increasing in amplitude despite the compensation measures."

The display showed a time-series analysis of boundary stability metrics, data Elian had provided to Mira the previous night, now presented officially for the first time.

"These readings suggest fundamental resonance effects that could amplify when the Atlantic station comes online," Elian continued. "Creating a network before we fully understand these dynamics introduces unnecessary risk."

Victor's jaw tightened, his gaze locking onto Elian like a predator sizing prey. "Risk is inherent in progress, Director Reeves. Your environmental concerns have been noted and addressed in the implementation plan."

"Have they?" Elian challenged, unusual defiance in his tone. "Because the data suggests otherwise. The compensation algorithms are failing to prevent amplitude increase. Projecting current trends forward, we could see critical instability within months of network activation."

The room fell silent, chairs creaking as Victor and Elian faced off, their words slicing deeper than budget disputes. Mira seized the opportunity to reinforce Elian's point.

"My analysis supports Director Reeves's concerns," she said, activating her own display to show the environmental models she'd developed overnight. "These simulations indicate potential hyperstorm formation in convergence zones if the boundary instabilities continue to amplify."

The holographic projection showed swirling weather patterns developing at the edges of the modulation field, growing in intensity as the simulation progressed until they coalesced into massive storm systems unlike anything seen since the worst days of the Acceleration.

"This is speculative modeling based on worst-case assumptions," Victor's rebuttal came sharp, but his eyes twitched, a crack in his polished mask. "Dr. Nakamura, your assessment?"

The environmental systems director studied the simulation with a frown. "The model appears technically sound, though I would need to review the underlying assumptions. If accurate, it suggests a non-trivial risk of weather pattern destabilization."

"More than non-trivial," Elian pressed. "Catastrophic. And the Atlantic installation would create additional boundary zones, multiplying the effect."

Victor waved off their warnings, his timeline etched in stone. "These concerns will be addressed by the engineering team before the Atlantic station becomes operational. The timeline stands."

"Father," Elian said, his voice lowering slightly, "we're talking about potential weather pattern collapse across two ocean basins. Millions of lives could be at risk if these projections are accurate."

"And millions benefit from the stability Project Watershed provides," Victor countered. "Your environmental idealism continues to cloud your judgment, Elian. The Haven Board has reviewed all relevant data and approved the accelerated timeline."

"All relevant data?" Elian's expression hardened. "Or only the data that supports your predetermined conclusion?"

The challenge hung in the air, more personal than professional. Mira's fingers curled tight, his stubbornness a wall she couldn't breach. Elian was allowing his frustration to push him closer to revealing how much he knew about his father's manipulation of Project Watershed data.

"Perhaps," Mira interjected carefully, "a compromise position exists. Proceed with construction of the Atlantic installation while extending the testing and calibration phase to ensure these boundary concerns are fully addressed before network integration."

Victor's attention shifted back to her, his eyes narrowing slightly. "An interesting suggestion, Dr. Voss. Though I wonder why an external consultant would be so invested in our implementation timeline."

The subtle shift in his tone alerted Mira that she'd drawn unwanted attention. Victor Reeves was too shrewd to miss the coordination between her and his son.

"Professional thoroughness," she replied smoothly. "My reputation is built on accurate environmental assessment. I would be remiss not to highlight potential risks, particularly of this magnitude."

"Indeed." Victor studied her for a moment longer before addressing the room. "I appreciate the concerns raised. Dr. Chen, you will work with the engineering team to review the boundary stability data and provide a comprehensive assessment within 48 hours. Dr. Nakamura, please validate Dr. Voss's environmental models against our historical data."

He turned back to Mira. "Dr. Voss, I would appreciate a detailed report on your methodology and assumptions. My office will provide you with additional historical data to refine your analysis."

The response was measured, reasonable, and entirely tactical, Mira realized. Victor was neither dismissing their concerns nor altering his plans. He was simply creating the appearance of due diligence while maintaining his timeline.

"Of course," she agreed. "Though I would need access to the complete boundary stability dataset to provide a comprehensive assessment."

"Dr. Chen will ensure you receive appropriate data," Victor replied, the emphasis on "appropriate" not lost on Mira. Her access would remain limited to what Victor deemed necessary.

The meeting continued with technical updates from various department heads, but the air hung heavy as the meeting broke apart, voices hushed and steps quick. Mira caught Elian watching his father with barely concealed frustration. Their strategy had created documented concerns but failed to slow Victor's accelerated timeline.

As the meeting concluded, Victor made a final announcement. "Given the importance of the Atlantic installation, I'll be personally overseeing the final preparations. Chief Larson will assume security oversight of this station during my absence. I depart for Celestia Haven tomorrow."

This was unexpected. Victor leaving the station created both opportunities and complications for their plans.

"Director Reeves," Victor continued, addressing his son, "you will remain here to manage ongoing operations. I expect daily reports on system performance and boundary stability metrics."

"Yes, sir," Elian replied, his tone professionally neutral despite the earlier confrontation.

As the meeting dispersed, Mira gathered her materials, careful to maintain her consultant persona. Victor approached her as she prepared to leave.

"Dr. Voss," he said, his voice carrying just far enough for her to hear. "A moment of your time."

Mira turned, meeting his gaze with professional composure. "Of course, Mr. Reeves."

"Your environmental models are quite sophisticated for someone who's had access to our systems for less than a week." His voice rolled deep, forged by years stacking his empire brick by brick. "Almost as if you were already familiar with the technology."

A warning flared in Mira's mind. Victor was probing, testing her cover story. "I've studied similar current manipulation systems in theoretical contexts. The principles translate, even if the scale is different."

"Similar systems?" Victor raised an eyebrow. "Project Watershed's approach is proprietary. There are no 'similar systems' in operation or academic literature."

Mira maintained her composure despite the trap he'd laid. "I was referring to the theoretical work on current manipulation from the pre-Deluge period. The Sofia Institute published several papers on the concept before its... dissolution."

The mention of the Sofia Institute caused a subtle tightening around Victor's eyes. "You've studied their work?"

"It's foundational to understanding oceanic intervention strategies," Mira replied, watching his reaction carefully. "Though your implementation goes far beyond what they envisioned."

Victor's gaze pinned Elian, sharp as a blade's edge. "Indeed. The Sofia Institute lacked the vision to see the technology's full potential." He paused. "Tell me, Dr. Voss, have you ever visited New Valencia? Before the flooding, of course."

The question struck like a physical blow, though Mira kept her expression neutral. "No. I was quite young when the Acceleration began."

"A pity. It was a remarkable research center." Victor's eyes never left hers. "Many brilliant minds were lost when the sea wall failed. The Voss research team, for instance. Their work on marine adaptation was quite promising."

He knew. Or at least, he strongly suspected her true identity. Mira's grip on her pen tightened, the ink trembling. "I'm not familiar with their specific research."

"No?" Victor's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Well, perhaps that's for the best. The past is the past, after all. We must focus on the future Project Watershed will create."
