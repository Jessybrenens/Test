# Chapter 2: The Heir

Elian Reeves stood at the floor-to-ceiling window of his father's office, watching sunset paint Celestia Haven in gold and crimson. From the 137th floor of Oceanic Solutions' headquarters, the floating city resembled an elaborate jewel set upon endless blue. His fingertips pressed against glass, leaving smudges.

"You're not listening to me, son."

Elian's shoulders tensed before he turned. Victor Reeves sat behind a desk of salvaged redwood, one of the last old-growth trees harvested before the waters claimed them. At sixty-three, Victor's silver hair was precisely cut, spine straight as a carbon rod, eyes sharp as surgical tools.

"I heard every word, Father," Elian steadied his voice, though his chest tightened. "The southern agricultural platform needs expansion. The Tide Dweller labor dispute requires resolution. The Haven Council seeks our support for increased security measures." He paused. "Did I miss anything?"

Victor's eyes narrowed just enough that the room's chatter faltered, negotiators shifting in their seats.

"You heard. But you weren't listening." Victor jabbed a finger at the holographic report hovering above his desk. "These security measures aren't bureaucratic overreach. Tide Caller infiltration increased twenty-seven percent last quarter. They're becoming bolder, more organized."

Elian's jaw clenched. "Perhaps because Haven security keeps abducting them for 'research purposes'?"

"Study," Victor corrected, his voice dropping to that dangerous quiet. "Not abduction. These genetic anomalies could provide valuable insights. Adaptations we might harness."

"They're people, Father. Not specimens."

Victor's hand sliced through the air. "People with abilities that give them unfair advantages in a water-dominated world. Abilities they hide while infiltrating our society." He leaned forward, the desk creaking beneath his palms. "Your sympathy for the lower tiers is admirable in theory, Elian, but misplaced in practice. Our position requires pragmatism."

The familiar argument settled between them. Elian slid his hands into his pockets to hide their trembling.

"Speaking of pragmatism, I've been reviewing the Watershed Project files you granted me access to."

Interest flickered in Victor's eyes. "And?"

"The theoretical framework is sound, but the power requirements are prohibitive. We'd need to divert resources from three Haven sectors for initial testing alone."

"A temporary inconvenience for a permanent solution," Victor said. "If we could control water levels globally—"

"We'd be playing god," Elian finished. "Again."

The temperature in the room seemed to drop. Victor's face hardened.

"The first time wasn't playing god. It was survival." Victor stood, his chair rolling back with a soft hiss. He moved to the window, close enough that Elian caught the scent of sandalwood cologne. "Look at what we built from the ruins, son. Celestia Haven houses fifty thousand people in comfort and security. Our agricultural platforms feed millions. Our desalination technology provides clean water to even the Drowned communities."

Elian bit his tongue. The corporate savior narrative that Haven children learned instead of history.

"I understand the project's potential benefits," Elian said, choosing each word carefully. "I'm merely suggesting we consider less invasive approaches first. The restoration initiatives I've proposed—"

"Band-aids," Victor interrupted. "Your restoration projects might green a few rooftops or purify a few square kilometers of ocean, but they don't address the fundamental problem." He gestured toward the horizon, where the sun slipped beneath endless water, leaving a wound of red across the sky. "Seventy-five meters of sea level rise. Billions displaced. Entire nations erased. The world needs more than incremental improvements, Elian. It needs transformation."

He scrolled through redacted files, each stamp a reminder of the warnings his father's generation had buried for another quarter's gain.

"I'll review the power requirement calculations again," Elian conceded. "Perhaps there's an efficiency we've overlooked."

Victor's expression softened marginally. He placed a hand on Elian's shoulder—the weight unfamiliar.

"You have your mother's heart, Elian. She always worried about the human cost too." Something flickered behind Victor's eyes—quickly buried. "But remember what she used to say: 'Compassion without action is just sentiment.'"

The mention of his mother sent an ache through Elian's chest. Sophia Reeves had died when he was fourteen—a "rare autoimmune disorder" according to official records. Nineteen years later, her absence remained a wound.

"I remember," Elian said quietly. What Victor omitted was the rest of Sophia's saying: "And action without compassion is just cruelty."

Victor's comm unit chimed. He checked the notification, frown deepening.

"The Haven Council meeting has been moved up. We'll continue this discussion tomorrow." He straightened his jacket. "I expect you at the Watershed Project review at 0900. Dr. Nakamura is presenting the latest simulation results."

Elian nodded. "I'll be there."

After Victor left, Elian remained by the window, watching Celestia Haven's lights illuminate against darkening sky. From this height, the barriers separating Haven elite from Tide Dweller service class disappeared. The security drones patrolling the perimeter vanished. The Drowned communities clustered around the floating city's moorings, surviving on scraps, became invisible.

He waited fifteen minutes, counting seconds, to ensure Victor was well on his way before approaching his father's private terminal. As CEO's son and heir apparent, Elian had extensive access privileges—though not unlimited. What he planned would be considered corporate espionage at best, treason at worst.

"James," he spoke into his personal comm unit. "Is the path clear?"

"Yes, sir," his assistant replied promptly. "Your father's transport left the dock three minutes ago. Security cameras on the executive floor are running the loop program for the next twenty minutes—standard privacy protocol during your father's absence."

"Thank you. Please ensure I'm not disturbed."

"Of course, sir. Your 'deep work' status has been activated in the building system."

Elian's lips curved slightly. James had been with him for five years—initially assigned by Victor to report on his activities, a fact both men acknowledged openly now. Over time, James had seen enough to make his own decisions about loyalty.

Elian placed his palm on the terminal's biometric scanner, pulse quickening as the cool surface read his prints. The system recognized him, but a secondary authentication screen appeared—requesting a password for restricted archives. He entered the code he'd obtained by observing his father's keystrokes during a moment of distraction last week.

The screen flashed green. Access granted.

Elian navigated to the historical archives—specifically, pre-flood corporate records. Most Haven residents believed these records had been lost during the Deluge. In reality, corporations had maintained meticulous backups of anything potentially useful or incriminating.

He searched for files related to climate research suppression of the 2060s—when the Acceleration phase might still have been prevented. Most files were heavily redacted or encrypted. But occasionally, fragments slipped through.

A memo from 2063 caught his attention:

FROM: V. Reeves
TO: Executive Committee
SUBJECT: Sofia Institute Findings

The SI projections must not reach regulatory agencies. Containment protocol Alpha is authorized. Dr. Voss and her team require special handling. Plausible deniability essential.

Recommendation: Acquisition of SI through shell corporation followed by immediate dissolution. Research materials to be secured in deep storage facility 9.

This communication will self-delete in 24 hours.

Elian stared at the screen, heart hammering against ribs. Dr. Voss. The name meant nothing to him, but the implications were clear. His father had personally ordered climate research suppression—research that might have prevented the catastrophe.

And "special handling" was corporate euphemism for something far darker than employment termination.

He copied the file to his secure drive, fingers trembling slightly. Another document appeared—a fragment of a larger report:

...genetic adaptations observed in approximately 0.03% of test subjects exposed to compound SX-7 during trials. Adaptations include enhanced pressure resistance, oxygen efficiency, and limited hydrokinetic capabilities. Subjects display distinctive dermal markings resembling scales...

The document was dated 2097—during the Deluge. This aligned with the emergence of the first Tide Callers, contradicting the official narrative of spontaneous mutations caused by environmental stress.

A soft chime interrupted—James's warning that his window was closing. Elian quickly copied the fragment and closed the terminal, erasing all traces with practiced efficiency.

He straightened his jacket and composed his features into the mask of dutiful corporate heir. By the time he left the office, not even sophisticated emotional recognition software would detect anything amiss.

His private transport waited at the executive dock, sleek lines gleaming under artificial lighting. As he settled into the interior, the scent of real leather surrounded him. He activated his secure communication device—unknown to Haven security or his father's surveillance.

"Dr. Chen," he said when the connection established. "I've found something you should see. Can you meet tonight?"

"The usual place?" The elderly archivist's voice crackled through the encrypted channel.

"Yes. And Dr. Chen? Be careful. I think we're getting close to something they'll kill to protect."

He ended the transmission and gazed out at Celestia Haven as his transport navigated between gleaming towers. The floating city's lights reflected in the dark water below, creating twin cities—one of privilege, one of illusion.

Elian's mind twisted, loyalties knotting against each other. His father's memo. The Tide Caller origins. His mother's death. The pieces fit together in ways that made his blood run cold.

The transport docked at his private residence—a "modest" penthouse by Haven standards. As the door slid open, Elian checked his secure drive, confirming the stolen files remained intact. Tonight, he would add them to his growing collection of evidence. Tomorrow, he would play the dutiful heir at the Watershed Project meeting.

And soon, perhaps, he would have enough to bring his father's empire crashing down.
