# Chapter 7: The Arrival

Mira stood at the transport's viewport as the North Pacific modulation station grew against endless blue. From above, the station sprawled like a steel bloom, its platforms fanning out to grip the waves.

"Approaching final descent, Dr. Voss. Please secure any loose items," the transport pilot's voice crackled.

Mira checked her equipment bag. Standard oceanographic tools for her consultant role, but with Kai's modifications—a water quality analyzer doubling as data extraction device, a current meter capable of interfacing with security systems.

She touched the pendant at her neck, Mediterranean water responding. Even thousands of kilometers from Tidefall, the ocean recognized her. Pacific currents swirled beneath, patterns shifting as they encountered the station's energy field.

Sophia's briefing had focused on technical vulnerabilities and access points, but hadn't prepared Mira for the visceral reaction to the modulation technology. The water felt wrong—disrupted in ways that made her skin prickle.

The transport descended through the station's security field, viewport shimmering briefly. Her credentials had cleared in advance—Dr. Marina Voss, oceanographic consultant, invited by Project Director Elian Reeves himself.

Mira reviewed her objectives: assess the modulation technology and confirm system instability; locate evidence linking Victor Reeves to the New Valencia sabotage; evaluate Elian Reeves as a potential ally.

That last objective complicated matters. Her interaction with Elian at the Haven gathering had left conflicting impressions. His environmental concerns seemed genuine, his invitation unexpected. Yet he remained Victor Reeves's son, raised in Haven privilege.

The transport settled onto the landing platform. Through the viewport, a small welcoming party waited—two security officers in Haven uniforms, and a woman in a lab coat, dark hair pulled back in a practical bun.

Not Elian. Not yet.

Mira gathered her equipment, adopting Dr. Marina Voss's professional demeanor. The persona felt both foreign and familiar after years of preparation. She'd studied oceanography extensively, could discuss post-flood adaptation patterns with genuine expertise. The best covers contained more truth than fiction.

The platform shivered beneath her boots, the ocean's pulse seeping through the steel. The wind lashed the platform, flinging brine against her skin.

"Dr. Voss," the woman in the lab coat extended her hand. "I'm Dr. Mei Nakamura, lead scientist for Project Watershed. Welcome to the North Pacific modulation station."

"Thank you for having me." Nakamura's grip was firm, her gaze direct.

"Director Reeves asked me to escort you to your quarters. He's currently in a meeting but will join us for the afternoon briefing." Nakamura gestured toward an entrance. "If you'll follow me."

Security officers flanked them as they entered the station proper. Mira noted their positioning—professional but watchful. Standard procedure, or something more targeted?

The interior corridors displayed Haven efficiency—sleek surfaces, recessed lighting, subtle system displays. Unlike Celestia Haven's ostentatious luxury, the station prioritized function, though still with refined corporate aesthetics.

"The station houses approximately two hundred personnel," Nakamura explained. "Research teams, engineering crews, security, and support staff. Most serve three-month rotations, though some core team members have been here since initial construction."

"How long has the station been operational?" Mira asked, already knowing from Sophia's briefing.

"Full operational status was achieved four months ago, but we've been running tests for nearly a year." Nakamura's tone remained measured. "The current modulation technology represents decades of research."

A lift carried them downward, pressure changing subtly in Mira's ears. The doors opened to a corridor with viewports showing the ocean. At thirty meters depth, filtered sunlight still illuminated the water, occasional fish visible against blue.

"Guest quarters are on this level," Nakamura led her to a door that slid open at their approach. "You'll have access to research levels and common areas. Your credentials are programmed into the system."

The room contained a sleeping area, small workspace, and private bathroom. A viewport offered a view of marine life, creating an illusion of greater space.

"The briefing begins at fourteen hundred hours in the main conference room," Nakamura continued. "That gives you two hours to settle in. The facility map is available on your room terminal."

Mira set her equipment bag on the desk. "I understand Director Reeves requested environmental impact assessments. Will I have access to the current data?"

Something flickered in Nakamura's expression. "Yes, I've prepared the relevant datasets for your review. They'll be available during the briefing." She paused. "Director Reeves values external perspective on our work."

The emphasis on "Director Reeves" rather than simply "Reeves" suggested a distinction—Elian versus Victor.

"I appreciate the opportunity," Mira said. "Few outside consultants get access to Haven projects of this significance."

"Few outside consultants have your qualifications," Nakamura replied, gaze direct. "Your work on post-flood adaptation patterns is particularly relevant to our current phase."

Nakamura's communication device chimed. She checked it, expression shifting. "Excuse me, I need to attend to this. Please use the room terminal if you require anything before the briefing."

After Nakamura left, Mira swept the quarters for surveillance devices. She found two standard monitoring systems—one in the main room, one near the entrance—both officially acknowledged in the guest information. Nothing covert her equipment detected.

She unpacked, arranging instruments as any consultant would. The water quality analyzer on the desk, its secondary functions hidden behind legitimate programming. The current meter joined it, along with sampling containers and data tablets.

Mira moved to the viewport. At this depth, water pressure remained modest compared to the station's lowest levels. Yet she sensed the disruption in natural current patterns. The modulation technology's effects rippled outward, unmistakable to her heightened awareness.

The pendant warmed against her skin, Mediterranean water responding to the Pacific's distress.

She accessed the room terminal, reviewing facility maps and security protocols. The station's design was complex but logical—research levels below residential, engineering and core systems deeper still. The modulation array extended from the lowest level, anchored to the ocean floor kilometers below.

The main conference room was two levels up, near administration. The route from her quarters included several security checkpoints.

A notification appeared on the terminal—a message from Elian Reeves.

"Dr. Voss, welcome to the North Pacific station. I look forward to our discussion at the briefing. Please be advised that my father, Victor Reeves, has joined us unexpectedly and will be attending as well. – E.R."

Mira read it twice. "Unexpectedly" suggested Elian hadn't planned his father's presence. A warning, perhaps?

Her fingers tightened on the pendant, the water inside trembling as Victor's name echoed in her head. She'd stepped into his shadow now, no turning back.

Mira prepared, reviewing her cover identity. Dr. Marina Voss had published papers on oceanic adaptation patterns following the Deluge. She had consulted for research institutions, though never directly for Haven corporations. Her academic credentials were impeccable, her professional reputation solid but not exceptional enough to draw undue attention.

A carefully constructed identity, years in the making. Now facing its most significant test.

At thirteen fifty-five, Mira left her quarters for the conference room. The corridors bustled with facility personnel moving between sections. Most wore practical research or engineering uniforms, occasional Haven corporate attire marking administrative staff.

She passed two security checkpoints, credentials scanned without issue. The guards' attention shifted to the next person before she'd fully passed—standard procedure rather than targeted surveillance.

The conference room doors stood open, revealing a large space with a central table. Viewscreens lined the walls, displaying ocean current visualizations and energy patterns. A floor-to-ceiling viewport showed the ocean where sunlight still penetrated.

Dr. Nakamura conferred with two researchers over a data tablet. She nodded as Mira entered. "Dr. Voss, please take any available seat. We'll begin shortly."

Mira chose a position allowing observation of both door and viewport. Other personnel arrived—researchers and engineers nodding to Nakamura before finding seats.

The atmosphere shifted when Elian Reeves entered. Conversations quieted, postures straightened. He moved with confidence but without the arrogance typical of Haven executives. His attire was more practical than at the gathering—still expensive, but designed for a working environment.

His gaze found hers immediately. "Dr. Voss," he approached. "Thank you for accepting our invitation on such short notice."

"The opportunity was too interesting to decline," Mira rose to shake his hand. The brief contact sent an unexpected current through her fingers.

"I hope your transport was comfortable," Elian continued, his tone professional but with underlying warmth. "It's not a short journey from Tidefall."

"Quite comfortable, thank you." Mira maintained her professional demeanor despite his intense gaze. "Dr. Nakamura mentioned you've prepared environmental data for review?"

"Yes, though there have been some recent developments—" Elian began, interrupted by the conference room doors sliding open.

Victor stepped in, and the air bent, voices faltering in his wake. Tall and imposing despite his age, silver-haired with cold eyes that assessed everything with calculating precision. Two security officers followed, their uniforms marking them as his personal detail.

"Director," Victor acknowledged his son before his gaze settled on Mira. "And this must be our external consultant."

Elian revealed nothing, though tension appeared in his shoulders. "Father, this is Dr. Marina Voss, the oceanographic specialist I mentioned. Dr. Voss, my father, Victor Reeves, CEO of Oceanic Solutions."

"A pleasure, Mr. Reeves," Mira said, voice steady despite the surge beneath. This man was responsible for her parents' death. The architect of Project Watershed. Standing before her, extending his hand.

She took his hand briefly, maintaining her professional mask. Victor's smile curved, a thin veil over the steel in his eyes—just another specialist, useful but ultimately insignificant.

"Tidefall University," he remarked. "An interesting choice for consultation, Elian. Their research methodologies are rather... traditional."

"Which provides valuable contrast to our approach," Elian replied. "Dr. Voss's work on adaptation patterns offers perspective our internal teams might overlook."

Victor made a noncommittal sound, moving toward the head of the table. The room's dynamics shifted to accommodate him, attention redirecting.

"Let's begin," he announced. "I have limited time before returning to Celestia Haven."

Elian caught Mira's eye briefly, something apologetic in his expression. Nakamura activated the main display, showing the modulation station and its effects on surrounding ocean currents.

"Project Watershed status report," she began. "The North Pacific installation has maintained stable operation for seventeen weeks, with current deflection patterns achieving ninety-three percent of projected efficacy."

The presentation continued with technical achievements and operational metrics. Mira noted discrepancies between this official narrative and Sophia's briefing. The stability metrics seemed optimistic, the energy consumption figures suspiciously efficient.

The environmental impact section showed minimal disruption to marine ecosystems, with adaptive measures supposedly mitigating negative effects.

"Our monitoring indicates no significant adverse impact on local marine populations," Nakamura concluded. "Migration patterns show expected seasonal variations within normal parameters."

Victor nodded with satisfaction while Elian's expression remained neutral. Too neutral—the perfect mask of someone hiding their true assessment.

"Questions?" Nakamura asked.

"The boundary stability readings on slide fourteen," Mira said, keeping her tone professionally curious. "The oscillation pattern shows increasing amplitude at the outer perimeter. Has that trend been consistent?"
