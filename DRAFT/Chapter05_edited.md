# Chapter 5: The Meeting

Moonlight filtered through broken ceiling panels of the abandoned desalination plant, casting silver patterns across rusted machinery. Salt and decay permeated the air, remnants of forgotten technology lingering in Tidefall's outskirts.

Mira arrived an hour early, scouting the perimeter and mapping three escape routes. The pendant of Mediterranean water rested against her collarbone as she positioned herself behind a support column at midnight, main entrance in clear view. The pipes thrummed under her touch, a pulse that matched the heat coiling in her gut.

"You move like someone accustomed to being hunted."

The voice came from behind her. Mira spun, fingers finding the knife at her belt.

An elderly woman stood in a doorway that hadn't existed moments before, a section of wall perfectly disguised. Silver hair pulled back in a severe bun framed a face etched with years but unmarked by frailty. Her eyes assessed Mira with undiminished precision.

"Dr. Sophia Reeves," Mira said, forcing her hand away from the weapon.

The woman inclined her head. "And you're Mira Voss. Elena and David's daughter." Her gaze softened. "You have your mother's eyes."

The casual mention of her parents' names sent a jolt through Mira's chest.

"Dr. Reyes said you have evidence," Mira kept her voice level. "About New Valencia. About my parents."

"I have evidence about many things." Sophia gestured toward the hidden doorway. "Security drones have increased their patrol patterns recently."

Mira hesitated, caution battling against the pull of answers.

"How do I know this isn't a trap?"

A ghost of a smile crossed Sophia's face. "Your mother asked the same thing when we first met." She withdrew a small object from her pocket, offering it on her palm.

A weathered university ID badge. Elena Voss, Marine Biology Department. The photo showed Mira's mother smiling.

"She gave me this the day before the evacuation," Sophia said. "For safekeeping, she said."

Mira's fingers trembled as they brushed against the laminated surface, worn smooth from handling.

"Come," Sophia turned toward the hidden door. "Time has never been our ally."

The passage led to a small living space carved from the plant's former control room. Screens lined one wall displaying data feeds and security camera views. A modest sleeping area occupied one corner, a workstation another.

"You've been hiding here? In Tidefall?" Mira took in the surroundings.

"Not continuously," Sophia moved to a console, entering a sequence. "I maintain several locations throughout what remains of the Pacific Rim. This one serves current purposes."

The largest screen flickered to life, displaying ocean current patterns similar to those Victor Reeves had shown during the Haven gathering.

"Project Watershed," Mira said.

Sophia's words sharpened, each one clipped as if bitten off. "Victor's attempt to play god with what remains of our world." She zoomed in on the North Pacific installation. "But you came for answers about the past, not warnings about the future."

She lowered herself into a chair, gesturing for Mira to do the same. For a moment, her composed facade cracked, revealing something underneath.

"I met your parents in 2095, during the early Acceleration phase. The Sofia Institute needed field data to refine our sea level projections. Elena and David continued their research as the waters rose."

"The Sofia Institute, your name."

A nod. "My life's work, before Victor destroyed it." Her gaze slid away, caught in some memory. "We were close, once. He funded the Institute's early research, championed our findings." Her fingers traced an invisible pattern on the table. "Until the projections threatened corporate interests."

"What changed him?"

"Power. Money. Perhaps fear." Sophia's expression hardened. "Our models predicted not just environmental collapse but societal upheaval. The corporations that had profited from climate destruction would face accountability. Victor chose self-preservation."

She tapped a command, bringing up a document on screen. "This suppression order he issued in 2063 began the end for the Sofia Institute."

Mira recognized it immediately, the same memo from Dr. Reyes's office. Confirmation that Victor Reeves had personally ordered the destruction of climate research.

"By 2097, the Acceleration had surpassed even our most pessimistic models," Sophia continued. "Your parents coordinated the scientific response in New Valencia."

Her voice dropped. "What you may not know is that New Valencia housed evidence of corporate climate crimes, including Oceanic Solutions' early weather modification experiments."

"The precursor to Project Watershed," Mira said, connections forming.

"Yes. Victor couldn't allow that research to reach the public." Sophia's eyes met Mira's. "He ordered Oceanic Solutions security to prevent 'unauthorized evacuations' from the New Valencia region."

She displayed another document, a security directive bearing Victor's signature and authorization code.

"They disabled the evacuation vessels' navigation systems," Sophia said. "When the sea wall failed ahead of schedule, the ships were trapped in the harbor. Twenty-three vessels. Over four thousand people."

Including her parents. Her chest burned, a heat she couldn't name pressing against her ribs. "They murdered them to protect corporate secrets."

"Yes."

"And you've been gathering evidence since then," Mira said. "Why not release it? Why hide for twenty years?"

Calculation flickered behind Sophia's grief. "Evidence without leverage is just history. The Haven corporations control information flow. They would discredit any accusations, bury any evidence." Her hand clenched. "I needed something more. A way to force accountability."

"Project Watershed," Mira realized. "You've been monitoring Victor's work."

"For years." Sophia stood, moving to the display. "The project itself is based partly on my research, twisted and weaponized. Victor believes he's creating a system to control ocean currents, to manage what remains of our world."

Her finger traced the installation points on the map. "What he doesn't know is that the system is fundamentally flawed. The energy requirements alone make it unsustainable, but more critically, the current manipulations will create cascading instabilities in global weather patterns."

"You're saying it won't work?"

"It will work," Sophia's voice hardened. "For a time. Long enough for Haven to consolidate control over remaining resources. But within five years, the system will begin to fail. The resulting current disruptions would trigger hyperstorms beyond anything we've seen since the Deluge."

Mira absorbed this, the scale staggering. "Another catastrophe, with Haven controlling who survives."

"Precisely." Determination burned in Sophia's eyes. "We must stop it before the network is complete. The North Pacific installation is operational but isolated. If we can access its control systems, we can demonstrate the fatal flaws while simultaneously releasing evidence of past climate crimes."

"We?" Mira asked.

"I've built a network. People who remember the truth, who have skills and access." Sophia studied Mira with new intensity. "Your abilities as a Tide Caller would be invaluable. The installation is underwater, guarded against conventional approaches."

Mira touched her pendant. "You knew what I am."

"Your mother told me, before the end. She was proud of you. Saw your connection to water as evolution, not aberration." Sophia's voice softened. "She believed Tide Callers represented humanity's adaptation to the world we created."

The knowledge of her mother's acceptance eased something in Mira's chest.

"There's something else you should know," Sophia said. "About Elian."

"Your son." Mira kept her expression neutral despite her quickening pulse.

"He doesn't know I'm alive." Pain crossed Sophia's face. "I've watched him from afar, seen him question his father's methods. He's positioned himself as Project Director to moderate Victor's ambitions, but he doesn't understand the fundamental flaws."

"You want to recruit him too," Mira said.

"He has access we need. Knowledge of the system architecture." Sophia's gaze held steady. "And he deserves to know the truth about his father. About me."

Mira recalled her encounter with Elian at the Haven gathering. His environmental concerns had seemed genuine, his invitation unexpected.

"I met him," she admitted. "At a Haven gathering. He invited me to consult on Project Watershed's environmental impact assessments."

Surprise flashed across Sophia's face, quickly replaced by calculation. "That's... unexpected. And potentially valuable." She edged closer, hooked on Mira's every syllable. "What impression did you form of him?"

"Conflicted," Mira said. "Intelligent. Possibly genuine in his environmental concerns. But still his father's son."

"Not entirely," Sophia murmured. "Not where it matters most." She straightened. "This changes our approach. Your connection to Elian provides an entry point we didn't have before."

"You want me to use him," Mira stated.

"I want you to give him a chance to choose the right side of history." Sophia's voice hardened. "The same chance I never gave his father."

The implications hung between them, personal revenge versus global stakes, past wrongs versus future catastrophe.

"What exactly are you proposing?" Mira asked.

"Accept his invitation. Gain his trust. Assess whether he can join our effort." Sophia's expression remained unyielding. "If he can, we'll proceed with his help. If not, we have alternatives."

Mira weighed this against her years of planning. Her goal had always been Victor Reeves's downfall, justice for her parents and countless others. Sophia offered a path to that justice, but one that involved Elian Reeves in ways Mira hadn't anticipated.

"And if I refuse?"

"Then we proceed without you," Sophia said. "But with less chance of success, and greater risk to those involved."

The weight of decision pressed on Mira. Her parents' faces flashed in her memory, determined and afraid as they helped others onto evacuation vessels that would never escape the harbor.

"I'll do it," she said. "But I need to know everything about Project Watershed, about Victor's security, about your network."

Relief flickered across Sophia's face. "We begin immediately." She activated another screen.

As night deepened outside the hidden room, Sophia revealed the architecture of Project Watershed, its components, vulnerabilities, and the catastrophic flaws in its design. Mira absorbed each detail, mind mapping connections between the technical specifications and potential points of intervention.

The screens cast blue light across their faces as they bent over diagrams, Sophia's finger tracing critical junctures in the system. Her knowledge was intimate, suggesting years of infiltration and analysis. This wasn't just about revenge, this was her life's work redirected toward prevention.

"The primary control node here," Sophia indicated a section of the underwater installation, "manages the energy distribution to the current modulators. Access requires both biometric authentication and encrypted command sequences."

"Elian would have both," Mira said.

"Yes. But Victor maintains override protocols." Sophia's lips wavered, a glint of doubt crossing her gaze. "He trusts his son's expertise, not his judgment."

Mira studied the facility's layout, noting water intake systems, pressure points, structural vulnerabilities. Places where a Tide Caller might exploit the ocean itself to gain entry.

"I'll need to practice," she said, fingers hovering over the schematic. "My abilities have limits."

"We have time to prepare," Sophia replied. "But not much. Victor plans to bring the Atlantic installation online within six months. Once the network expands beyond a single node, our window closes."

Dawn approached, pale light seeping through the facility's broken panels. Sophia shut down the displays, security protocols engaging with soft clicks and whirs.

"Contact Elian," she said, handing Mira a small communication device. "Accept his invitation. This will allow us to communicate securely."

Mira took the device, its weight insignificant compared to the responsibility it represented. "And if he suspects something?"

"Then you withdraw, and we pursue alternative approaches." Sophia's eyes held Mira's. "But I don't think he will. You have something he needs, external validation of his concerns. And perhaps something more."

The implication hung between them, unaddressed.

"I should go," Mira said. "Tide Dweller patrols will increase with daylight."

Sophia nodded, leading her toward a different exit than the one she'd entered, a narrow passage that emerged behind a cluster of abandoned processing tanks.

"Your mother would be proud," Sophia said at the threshold, her hand briefly touching Mira's arm. "Not just of what you are, but of what you're choosing to do."

The words followed Mira as she navigated back through Tidefall's awakening pathways, the rising sun turning the endless ocean into a sheet of hammered gold. Her thoughts spun, jagged edges snagging on one risk after another.

She had come seeking answers about her parents' death and found a conspiracy spanning decades. She had come seeking revenge against Victor Reeves and found herself enlisted in a mission to prevent another global catastrophe.

And somewhere in this tangled web stood Elian Reeves, son of her enemy, son of her new ally, and now her target in ways she hadn't anticipated.

Mira's fingers closed around the communication device in her pocket. The water around Tidefall responded to her turbulent emotions, currents shifting subtly beneath the floating structures. One step closer to justice, but on a path far more complex than she had imagined.
