# Chapter 6: The Consultation

Elian Reeves watched technicians in pressure suits make final adjustments to the external array from the North Pacific modulation station's observation deck. Through reinforced viewport, darkness stretched vast and impenetrable, broken only by station lights. Three kilometers below surface, the ocean waited to crush anything unprotected.

The facility represented decades of research and development. His father called it humanity's redemption. Elian saw it balanced on a knife's edge.

"Simulation results from the latest test sequence, sir."

Dr. Nakamura offered a data tablet, her expression neutral save for tightness around her eyes.

"Thank you, Mei." He scanned the figures, unease growing. Energy consumption exceeded projections by seventeen percent. Current deflection patterns showed increasing instability at outer boundaries. Small deviations now, but the trend pointed toward significant disruptions if scaled to a global network.

"Have you shared these with my father?" Elian kept his voice casual despite tension in his chest.

"Not yet. I wanted your assessment first." Mei glanced toward two security officers near the deck entrance, their Haven corporate insignia marking them as his father's personal detail. "The results are... open to interpretation."

"Let's discuss this in my office."

Once inside his workspace, Elian activated the signal dampener built into his desk. The soft hum provided cover for words that couldn't be overheard.

"The boundary instabilities are worsening," Elian said. "Push to three stations, and Mei's models show hyperstorms tearing through convergence zones."

Elian pressed his fingers to his skull, weariness seeping into his marrow. "We need more data on the deep current interactions. The models are only as good as their inputs."

"Which is why your oceanographer consultant is so timely," Mei said, curiosity in her voice. "Dr. Voss, correct? Impressive field experience with post-flood adaptation patterns."

"Yes." Elian kept his expression neutral, though Mira's name sparked something in him, a twitch beneath his ribs he couldn't place. "She's joining us tomorrow for the preliminary assessment. Her perspective might help us identify what we're missing."

If she was what she appeared to be. The background check had verified her professional credentials, but something about Dr. Marina Voss—Mira—had triggered his instincts during their conversation at the Haven gathering. She'd seemed too perceptive, too immediately focused on the project's environmental implications.

"I'll prepare the environmental impact data for her review," Mei said. "Though I should warn you—the preliminary findings won't support your father's timeline for expansion."

"I'm counting on that," Elian replied. "We need solid scientific grounds to delay the Atlantic and Indian Ocean installations until we resolve these stability issues."

Mei studied him, assessing more than just the technical problem. "Your father isn't known for his patience with delays."

"No," Elian agreed, the word heavy with unspoken history. "But even he can't argue with physics."

A chime from his communication unit interrupted them—a priority alert from Haven. Elian checked the message, his expression darkening.

"My father has moved up the project review. He'll be arriving at the station tomorrow morning." He looked up at Mei. "The same day as Dr. Voss."

"Hell of a time for him to show up," Mei muttered.

"No, it's not." Elian's mind raced through implications and contingencies. "Prepare two versions of the simulation results. The complete analysis for me, and a... selectively edited version for the official presentation."

Mei's eyebrows rose slightly. "Selectively edited?"

"Nothing falsified," Elian clarified. "Just emphasizing the successful aspects while contextualizing the concerns as routine optimization challenges."

It wasn't the first time he'd managed information flow to his father. A necessary tactic when dealing with a man who saw obstacles as personal affronts rather than technical realities.

"I understand," Mei said, her expression suggesting reservations. "And Dr. Voss?"

"I'll handle that introduction carefully." Elian stood, signaling the end of their conversation. "Continue the boundary stability tests. Document everything meticulously."

After Mei left, Elian stared at the simulation results. The numbers flickered across the screen, a jagged rhythm hinting at collapse. His father's vision of controlling ocean currents was fundamentally flawed. Not in concept, but in execution and purpose.

Victor Reeves saw Project Watershed as the ultimate expression of Haven dominance—technology that would cement corporate control over what remained of human civilization. Elian had positioned himself as project director to moderate that vision, to ensure the technology served recovery rather than control.

But moderation might not be enough. Not if the boundary instabilities continued to worsen. Not if the system itself was inherently unstable at scale.

He accessed his private terminal, navigating to Dr. Voss's credentials and background. Her research on post-flood marine ecosystems was legitimate and well-regarded within academic circles. Her connection to Tidefall University gave her access to data outside Haven's usual information channels.

What the file didn't explain was the intensity in her eyes when discussing environmental impact, or the way she'd touched the water pendant at her neck when speaking of the flood's consequences. Something personal drove her interest—something the background check hadn't captured.

Elian closed the file, decision made. He would proceed with the consultation as planned, but with heightened awareness. Dr. Voss might be exactly what the project needed—an external perspective unconstrained by Haven politics. Or she might represent something else entirely.

Either way, her arrival coinciding with his father's complicated an already precarious situation.

He deactivated the signal dampener and headed toward his private quarters. The station's layout mimicked Haven architecture—efficiency masked by luxury, at least for those of appropriate rank. His rooms featured programmable wall screens currently displaying one of the few remaining old-growth preserves.

Elian accessed his secure communication device—unknown to Haven security or his father's surveillance. The connection took longer than usual, the signal penetrating three kilometers of ocean before reaching the nearest relay.

"Dr. Chen," he said when the connection established. "I need to accelerate our timeline. My father arrives tomorrow."

"That's problematic," the elderly archivist replied, voice crackling through the encrypted channel. "The analysis of those Sofia Institute fragments isn't complete."

"Do what you can. And there's something else—a consultant named Dr. Marina Voss is joining the project tomorrow. Oceanographic specialist from Tidefall."

A pause, longer than the transmission delay would explain.

"Voss," Dr. Chen repeated carefully. "Interesting coincidence."

"Is it?" Elian asked, suspicions sharpening. "Should I know that name?"

Another pause. "There were scientists named Voss among those lost in the New Valencia incident. Prominent climate researchers."

The New Valencia incident. One of the worst evacuation failures during the Acceleration phase. Thousands lost when sea walls failed ahead of schedule. The official record blamed inadequate engineering and unexpected storm surge.

"Relation?"

"Possibly. I'll look into it." Dr. Chen's voice lowered. "Be careful, Elian. If your father is accelerating his timeline, something has changed in the larger strategy."

"I know. Keep our people on alert." Elian ended the transmission and secured the device in its hidden compartment.

The coincidence—if it was coincidence—of Dr. Voss's consultation and his father's sudden visit left him uneasy. Victor Reeves didn't make impulsive schedule changes. Every movement was calculated, every interaction choreographed for maximum advantage.

Elian moved to the viewport in his quarters, staring out at the crushing darkness. The ocean's pressure surrounded the station, constant and unforgiving. One structural failure, one critical error, and everything would be obliterated.

The station's environmental systems hummed around him, maintaining the illusion of control in an environment designed to kill. His reflection stared back from the viewport glass—his father's jawline, his mother's eyes. The inheritance he couldn't escape.

He pressed his palm against the cold viewport. Tomorrow would bring Dr. Voss, with her pointed questions and water pendant. Tomorrow would bring his father, with his implacable will and corporate agenda.

The station's lights cast long shadows across the observation deck below. Technicians moved with practiced precision, making final adjustments to systems designed to bend the ocean to human will. Their confidence was admirable, perhaps misplaced.

Elian's secure tablet chimed with an incoming message—the latest boundary stability test results. He scanned the data, pulse quickening. The instabilities were growing faster than projected. The system was approaching a critical threshold sooner than anyone had anticipated.

He composed a message to Mei, encrypting it with their private protocol. They needed to run additional simulations before his father arrived. Before Dr. Voss arrived. Before the carefully constructed narrative of Project Watershed's success began to unravel.

His fingers hovered over the send button. If the instabilities continued at this rate, the entire project might need to be reconsidered. Years of work. Billions in resources. His father's defining legacy.

And perhaps, Elian thought as he sent the message, the fate of what remained of human civilization.

The ocean pressed against the viewport, patient and powerful. Inside the station, humans played at mastery while dancing on the edge of catastrophe. Tomorrow would bring either clarity or chaos.

Elian suspected it would bring both.
