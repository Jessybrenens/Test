# Chapter 16: Submerged Revelations

The expedition vessel had been gone for three weeks when Mira felt the first unsettling pulse through the water. She stood on Tidefall's eastern observation deck, her morning meditation interrupted by a rhythmic disturbance from New Valencia's ruins. A current throbbed through the water, steady as a heartbeat.

"You feel it too," Selene said, approaching from behind. The young Tide Caller had recovered from her injuries sustained at the North Pacific station, though a new scar traced her jawline where debris had struck during their escape.

Mira nodded, her fingers instinctively reaching for the pendant at her throat. "It started three days ago. Faint at first, but growing stronger."

"The others have noticed as well." Selene gestured toward a group of Tide Callers gathered at the far end of the deck, their expressions troubled as they gazed out over the water. "Something is disturbing the natural patterns. Something artificial."

Mira's thoughts turned to the Harmony expedition. "Could it be related to the research team's activities?"

"No." Selene's response was immediate and certain. "This comes from a different direction entirely. From New Valencia."

The name sent a familiar ache through Mira's chest. She traced the pendant's edge, the ruins pulling her back to that last goodbye.

"I need to investigate," Mira decided, already calculating what equipment she would need. "If someone is interfering with the ocean currents near New Valencia, we need to know who and why."

"The Council won't approve an official expedition," Selene warned. "Not with tensions still so fragile between Haven and the independent settlements."

"Then it won't be official." Mira met the younger woman's gaze. "Just me, alone."

"Not alone," Selene countered. "I'm coming with you."

Mira started to refuse, then reconsidered. Selene adjusted their course with a flick of her wrist, the water bending to her will more deftly than Mira remembered. Two sets of senses would catch what one might miss in those ruins.

"We leave at dawn," Mira conceded. "Tell no one except Kai. He'll cover for our absence."

The preparations were swift and discreet. A small submersible, ostensibly scheduled for maintenance, was stocked with supplies and diving equipment. Kai handed over comms units, his face tight as he hefted the last crate aboard.

"Three days," he instructed. "If you're not back or haven't made contact by then, I'm sending a search team."

Mira clasped his arm in gratitude. "We'll be careful."

"You're never careful," he replied, but there was affection beneath the exasperation. "Just come back alive."

They departed before the first light of dawn touched Tidefall's floating structures, the submersible easing into the channels threading from Tidefall. Selene took the navigation controls, the sub veering smooth along a current only she could feel.

Mira pored over the scant reports on New Valencia's ruins as the hours stretched ahead. After its deliberate sacrifice during the early years of Project Watershed, the once-thriving coastal research community had been largely abandoned, its structures claimed by the rising waters. Occasional salvage expeditions reported that much of the settlement remained intact beneath the waves, preserved in the cold depths like a museum to Haven's calculated cruelty.

What no expedition had ever reported, however, was any kind of technology that could generate the pulses they now felt disturbing the water.

"We're approaching the outer marker," Selene announced as the submersible's sonar detected the warning buoys that had been placed around New Valencia's perimeter. The buoys served dual purposes, warning vessels of underwater hazards and marking the site as a memorial to those who had perished.

Mira joined her at the viewport, her throat tightening at the sight of the ruins, a flicker of her mother's laugh surfacing unbidden. The lab's spire, once gleaming white, leaned under a shroud of kelp, its base studded with barnacles like the freckles she'd counted on her father's hands.

"The pulses are stronger here," Selene observed, her eyes half-closed as she extended her Tide Caller senses. "Coming from the eastern quadrant, near the old research district."

Her gut twisted as the pulses thrummed from her parents' lab.

"Take us closer," she instructed. "But maintain distance from the seafloor. I want to do a complete scan before we consider diving."

The submersible's lights sliced through the murk, baring the ruins' skeletal shapes. The streets she'd raced down as a child vanished under kelp fronds, twitching like restless ghosts. The admin building sagged, its roof caved where her father once waved from the steps. Beyond it, the residential district where Mira's family home had stood was barely recognizable, reduced to crumbling walls and scattered debris.

But sediment swirled fresh around the research district's edges, not yet settled.

"Someone's been here," Mira said, pointing to the evidence. "Recently."

Selene nodded, her expression troubled. "The water remembers their passage. Multiple vessels, heavy equipment. Within the last month."

The submersible's sensors suddenly emitted a warning tone. Selene's hands flew over the controls, interpreting the data.

"Metal detection, significant mass," she reported. "Not consistent with New Valencia's original structures. Something new."

"Or something hidden," Mira murmured. "Take us to the coordinates."

They approached cautiously, maintaining enough distance to observe without being easily detected. As they drew closer to her parents' old laboratory, Mira's suspicions crystallized into shocked certainty. Attached to the ruined foundation of the lab, partially concealed by the collapsed outer walls, was a structure that had no place in New Valencia's original design: a sleek, metallic installation with the unmistakable aesthetic of Haven architecture.

"It's a Haven facility," she breathed, anger and disbelief warring in her voice. "Built directly onto my parents' laboratory."

"It appears inactive," Selene observed, studying the sensor readings. "Minimal power signatures. But it's the source of the pulses."

Mira made her decision instantly. "I'm going to investigate. Closer scan first, then a direct dive."

The submersible circled the hidden facility, its sensors gathering detailed information about the structure. It was smaller than Haven's typical outposts, suggesting a specialized purpose rather than a full research station. No external markings identified its function, and the few visible viewports were dark.

"I'm not detecting any life signs," Selene reported after completing the scan. "If anyone was stationed here, they're gone now."

"Or the sensors can't penetrate the shielding," Mira countered, already pulling on her diving gear. "Haven has developed materials that can block most scanning technologies."

Selene looked troubled. "You should wait. We should return to Tidefall, report what we've found, come back with a proper team."

"No." Mira's tone left no room for argument. "By then, Haven could remove all evidence. This is their lab, Selene. I'm going in."

Recognizing the futility of further protest, Selene helped Mira complete her preparations. "I'll maintain position here, ready for immediate extraction. The communication link should work at that depth, but if it fails, I'll monitor for your emergency beacon."

Mira nodded, securing her oxygen supply and checking her equipment one final time. "If I'm not back in two hours, or if you detect any approaching vessels, don't wait. Return to Tidefall and bring help."

"Be careful," Selene urged as Mira moved toward the airlock. "The currents around the structure are strange, unpredictable."

"I was born in these waters," Mira replied with grim determination. "They know me."

The airlock cycled, and Mira plunged into the cold embrace of the ocean. Cold bit through her suit, sharp and sudden, while the ocean's weight pressed her ribs as she twisted to find her bearings.

The currents twisted against her, dragging where they should have flowed. Mira called upon her Tide Caller abilities, sensing the flow of water around her and adjusting her path accordingly. Even with her skills, the swim was challenging, the currents growing more chaotic as she approached the facility.

The source of the disturbance became apparent as she drew closer. A series of devices had been attached to the exterior of the facility, each emitting the rhythmic pulses she had sensed from Tidefall. The technology was unfamiliar, but its purpose seemed clear: to disrupt the natural current patterns, perhaps as a defense mechanism or to mask the facility's presence from Tide Caller senses.

Mira examined the building's exterior, looking for an entrance. The original laboratory structure had been almost completely enveloped by the Haven addition, with only fragments of the familiar architecture visible beneath the metallic overlay. She clenched her fists, the Haven metal gleaming over her parents' crumbled walls.

A sealed hatch on the facility's underside appeared to be the main entry point. Mira approached cautiously, examining the locking mechanism. It was Haven design, sophisticated but not impenetrable. From a waterproof pouch at her belt, she removed a small device Kai had given her months ago, a universal key that could bypass most Haven security systems.

The lock resisted initially, then yielded with a soft click that Mira felt rather than heard through the water. The hatch swung inward, revealing an airlock chamber beyond. Mira swam inside, sealed the outer door behind her, and activated the drainage system.

As water evacuated from the chamber, Mira felt the familiar disorientation of transitioning from liquid to air environment. When the chamber was fully drained, she removed her breathing apparatus but kept the rest of her diving gear on for a quick escape if necessary. The inner door unlocked automatically once the drainage was complete.

Mira drew a small light from her belt and a compact shock baton that could serve as both tool and weapon. Thus armed, she pushed open the inner door and entered the Haven facility.

Emergency lights flickered red, stretching the shadows of bolted pipes along the branching halls. The air hung heavy, like the damp cellars of her childhood hideouts, yet it still fed her lungs despite its haunting by a ghost of the systems her parents might have built.

Mira moved silently through the corridors, alert for any sign of current occupation. A chair teetered on its side, papers strewn across the floor, a cracked mug still half-full.

The central corridor led to what was clearly the main research area, a large chamber filled with sophisticated equipment. She traced a familiar sonar array with her fingers, then paused at a sleek, humming device, its controls a puzzle she couldn't crack.

At the chamber's center stood a sealed door marked with Haven's highest security classification. Haven's triple-lock sigil gleamed on the door as she swallowed hard, knowing what it guarded.

Mira approached the door, studying the security panel. This would not yield to Kai's universal key; it required direct authorization. She examined the room, looking for clues that might help her bypass the security.

A workstation near the door drew her attention. Unlike the other abandoned equipment, this one showed signs of recent use. A logbook lay open beside it, handwritten rather than digital, an unusual choice in Haven's technology-dependent culture.

Mira approached the workstation, her light illuminating the pages of the logbook. The handwriting was neat and precise, the entries dated over the past six months. The author identified himself only as "V.R." in the header, but Mira recognized the writing style immediately. Victor Reeves, Haven's chief science officer and the architect of Project Watershed.

Her hands trembled slightly as she began to read, the entries revealing a project codenamed "Tide Hunter" that focused on neutralizing Tide Caller abilities through targeted frequency disruption. The pulses she had felt were test patterns, designed to map the range at which Tide Callers could detect and potentially counter the technology.

But it was the later entries that caused Mira's breath to catch in her throat. Victor wrote of "legacy subjects" whose genetic material had provided the foundation for the research, subjects whose enhanced connection to ocean currents had been studied extensively before the project's relocation to this facility.

One entry in particular stood out, dated just two weeks after New Valencia's destruction:

"E.V.'s cellular samples continue to show remarkable resilience to the suppression field. Unlike other subjects, her genetic markers suggest an adaptive response that may render first-generation countermeasures ineffective. Recommend continued observation of living subject rather than relying solely on preserved tissue samples."

E.V. Elena Voss. Mira's mother.

The implication was clear and horrifying. Haven hadn't just destroyed New Valencia; they had extracted specific individuals first, including Elena Voss, keeping them as research subjects to study and exploit their Tide Caller abilities.

Mira flipped forward through the logbook, searching desperately for more information about her mother's fate. The entries became more clinical over time, referring to subjects by number rather than initials. Then, five years ago, a final notation regarding "Subject E-1" simply stated: "Terminal phase reached. Tissue samples archived. Subject terminated."

The file's final line, "terminated, non-viable," hit like a blade, years of her mother's silent screams trapped in cold text.

Mira's vision blurred with tears of rage and grief. The truth was worse than anything she had imagined during her years of searching. Her mother had survived the destruction of New Valencia, only to endure years as a research subject before being coldly executed when she no longer served Haven's purposes.

So absorbed was she in this devastating revelation that Mira failed to notice the subtle change in the facility's lighting, the emergency systems shifting from standby to active mode. It was only when a voice spoke from behind her that she realized she was no longer alone.

"Impressive," the female voice observed coolly. "Few could have bypassed our security so efficiently. You truly are Elena's daughter."

Mira spun around, shock baton raised defensively. A Haven security officer stood in the doorway, her uniform bearing the insignia of their elite internal security division. Her weapon was drawn but held casually, as if she didn't consider Mira a serious threat.

"Who are you?" Mira demanded, her voice raw with emotion. "What do you know about my mother?"

The woman smiled, the expression never reaching her cold eyes. "I knew her quite well. I supervised her final years in our research program. She spoke of you often, especially during the more... intensive phases of our work."

Mira lunged forward, rage overwhelming caution, but the security officer sidestepped with practiced ease.

"Your mother had the same temper," she remarked, still smiling. "It made breaking her all the more satisfying."

"You're lying," Mira snarled, circling warily. "The logbook says she died five years ago."

The woman's smile widened. "Does it? How convenient that you found exactly the information we wanted discovered. Victor always was thorough with his false trails."

Doubt crept into Mira's mind. Could the logbook be deliberate misinformation? A trap designed to be found?

"Where is she?" Mira demanded. "Where is my mother?"

"Not here, obviously," the officer replied with a dismissive gesture. "This facility was decommissioned weeks ago, after Victor's unfortunate attack of conscience at your little summit. We've relocated all valuable assets to more secure locations."

She raised her weapon, aiming it steadily at Mira's chest. "I'm afraid your family reunion will have to wait. Permanently."

Mira assessed her options rapidly. The security officer blocked the only exit, and her position gave her a clear shot. The shock baton would be useless against a projectile weapon at this distance.

"You won't kill me," Mira said, playing for time. "I'm too valuable as a research subject, just like my mother."

Something flickered in the woman's eyes, a momentary hesitation that told Mira she had struck close to the truth.

"Orders can change," the officer replied smoothly. "But you're right, your capture would be preferable. Your genetic profile is particularly interesting to our research division."

Mira's gaze darted around the room, seeking any advantage. The facility had been built with standard Haven protocols, which meant...

"You know what's interesting about Haven facilities?" Mira asked conversationally, slowly shifting her weight. "They all use the same emergency systems."

Before the officer could respond, Mira lunged toward a red panel on the wall, smashing it with the shock baton. Alarms blared instantly, and emergency protocols activated. Most crucially, the fire suppression system engaged, spraying water from ceiling nozzles throughout the facility.

For an ordinary person, this would provide little advantage. But for a Tide Caller, water was a weapon.

As the spray intensified, Mira extended her senses, gathering the water molecules into a concentrated mass and hurling it toward the security officer with devastating force. The woman fired her weapon, but the shot went wide as the water slammed into her, throwing her against the wall with bone-jarring impact.

Mira didn't wait to see if she would recover. She sprinted past the stunned officer, using her Tide Caller abilities to gather more water from the sprinklers, creating slick barriers behind her to impede pursuit.

The facility's emergency systems had triggered a lockdown, sealing compartments to contain potential damage. Mira raced through narrowing gaps as doors began to close, her knowledge of Haven protocols guiding her toward the nearest emergency exit.

Behind her, she could hear the security officer shouting orders, presumably into a communication device. More personnel would be converging on the facility, cutting off escape routes.

Mira reached a junction where three corridors met, momentarily disoriented. The sprinklers had stopped, limiting her advantage, and the emergency lighting made it difficult to read the directional markers.

A sound from her left made the decision for her. Mira darted right, only to find herself in what appeared to be a laboratory space. Equipment lined the walls, and in the center stood a large tank filled with murky liquid.

Mira froze, her attention captured by the tank's contents. Floating within was what appeared to be human tissue, preserved in solution. Labels on the tank identified the contents as "E-1 neural tissue, viable for phase 3 testing."

More of her mother, kept like a specimen even after death.

The sound of approaching footsteps broke Mira from her horrified trance. There was no exit from this room except the way she had come in, and that was now blocked by the security officer, her weapon raised and a trickle of blood running from her temple where she had struck the wall.

"Nowhere left to run," the woman observed, her earlier casual manner replaced by cold fury. "You've seen too much now. Orders or not, this ends here."

Mira backed up against the tank, her mind racing. The officer was right; there was nowhere to run. But perhaps there was somewhere to swim.

With a swift motion, Mira activated her shock baton at maximum setting and plunged it into the tank behind her. The glass cracked, then shattered as thousands of gallons of preservation fluid burst forth, sweeping both women off their feet in the sudden flood.

Mira had been prepared for the surge, using her Tide Caller abilities to ride the wave toward the door. The security officer was less fortunate, slammed against equipment by the unexpected deluge.

The flood of liquid carried Mira back into the corridor, where emergency containment protocols had already activated, sealing off the laboratory to contain the spill. The security officer was trapped inside, at least temporarily.

Mira struggled to her feet, soaked and disoriented but determined. She needed to find an exit before the entire facility was locked down or reinforcements arrived.

Following the emergency lighting, she made her way toward what she hoped was an exterior access point. The facility's systems were in chaos, some doors sealed shut while others had malfunctioned and remained open.

Finally, she reached what appeared to be a secondary airlock, similar to the one she had entered through. Mira quickly checked her diving gear, relieved to find it intact despite her rough journey through the facility.

As she prepared to cycle the airlock, a facility-wide announcement echoed through the corridors:

"Security breach in sector three. All personnel initiate Protocol Omega. Repeat, Protocol Omega is now active."

Mira didn't know what Protocol Omega entailed, but the urgency in the announcement suggested it wasn't good news for intruders. She hurried to complete the airlock sequence, her hands flying over the controls.

The inner door sealed just as she heard footsteps approaching from the corridor. Through the small viewport, she caught a glimpse of the security officer, now joined by several others in Haven uniforms, their weapons drawn.

The airlock began to fill with water, the process agonizingly slow compared to the standard emergency evacuation rate. They were overriding the system, Mira realized, trying to trap her in the chamber.

Water rose around her ankles, then her knees, but the cycle had been compromised. It would never complete in time. Through the viewport, she could see the security team preparing to override the inner door seal, which would flood the facility but give them a clear shot at her before she could escape.

Mira made a desperate decision. Using her Tide Caller abilities, she focused on the water already in the chamber, creating a localized pressure differential against the outer door. The metal groaned under the strain, the safety systems fighting her efforts.

The inner door's override sequence completed with a warning chime. Mira redoubled her efforts, channeling all her strength into the water pressure against the outer door.

With a shuddering crack, the outer door's seal failed, blown outward by the force of Mira's manipulation. Ocean water rushed in, the pressure differential creating a powerful current that swept Mira out into open water just as the inner door began to open.

She tumbled through the churning waters, fighting to orient herself as the facility's emergency systems triggered a complete lockdown, sealing all breaches automatically. The security team was trapped inside, at least for now.

Mira activated her emergency beacon, hoping Selene would respond quickly. Her oxygen hissed steady, but the tank's gauge ticked down too fast.

As she swam away from the facility, a movement in her peripheral vision caught her attention. A small, sleek Haven vessel was approaching rapidly, likely responding to the security breach.

Mira dove deeper, using the ruins of New Valencia for cover as she navigated toward where she hoped Selene would be waiting with the submersible. The Haven vessel deployed smaller pursuit craft, their lights cutting through the murky water as they searched for her.

Her lungs scraped raw, air barely trickling through the mask as she pushed herself to the limit, staying just ahead of her pursuers. Just when her strength began to fail, the submersible's familiar silhouette appeared ahead, Selene visible through the viewport, gesturing urgently for Mira to hurry.

With the last of her energy, Mira surged toward the waiting vessel, relief flooding through her as the airlock opened to receive her. She collapsed inside as the door sealed behind her, the chamber filling with air as water drained away.

"Mira!" Selene's voice penetrated her exhaustion as the inner door opened. "What happened? You're injured!"

Only then did Mira notice the cut on her arm, likely from the shattered tank. "Haven security," she gasped between ragged breaths. "They're coming. We need to go now."

Selene helped her into the main cabin, taking the controls and activating the engines. Through the viewport, Mira could see the lights of the pursuing vessels growing closer.

"They're faster than us," Selene observed grimly, her eyes on the sensor display. "And they're armed."

As if to emphasize her point, something struck the submersible's hull with a metallic clang. Not a direct hit, but close enough to confirm the danger.

"We can't outrun them," Mira acknowledged, securing a bandage over her arm. "We need to outsmart them."

She froze, the workbench's curve unchanged from when her father sketched equations across it, her mother's voice almost audible in the hum of old machines. The truth about her parents' fate, about Haven's continued experiments on Tide Callers, about the possibility that her mother might still be alive somewhere, all of it swirled in her mind, demanding action.

But first, they had to survive to bring this information back to Tidefall.

"There," Mira pointed to a section of the submerged city where tall buildings created a dense underwater maze. "The old financial district. The buildings are close together, passages too narrow for their larger vessels."

Selene nodded, adjusting their course. "It's risky. Lots of debris, collapsed structures."

"Better than being shot out of the water," Mira replied, her voice steadier now. "I know these ruins. My father used to take me through the city, showing me the architecture."

As Selene guided them into the labyrinth of New Valencia's remains, Mira clutched Victor's logbook, the evidence of Haven's crimes secured in her waterproof pouch. Whatever happened next, the truth would not remain buried beneath these waters. She would make sure of that, for her parents and for all the others who had suffered under Haven's ruthless pursuit of control.

The submersible vanished into the underwater maze, pursued by the lights of Haven vessels, as New Valencia kept its secrets in the cold, dark depths.
