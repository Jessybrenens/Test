# Chapter 4: The Gathering

The Haven elite gathered like exotic birds, their clothing a riot of colors and textures extinct in the world below for decades. Women draped in fabrics engineered to shift hues with body temperature, colors rippling across skin like oil on water. Men wearing jackets with illuminated seams pulsing in time with ambient music. Jewelry crafted from materials salvaged from flooded citiesâ€”gold and platinum alongside circuit boards and fiber optics repurposed as status symbols.

Mira observed from behind the mask of Dr. Marina Voss, oceanographic consultant. Her credentials, meticulously forged with Kai's help, identified her as a Tide Dweller specialist hired by the Haven Council's Environmental Assessment Committee. The invitation had cost her three months of planning and a significant portion of her savings, but it placed her within arm's reach of her target. Her palms dampened inside her gloves.

The Grand Atrium of Celestia Haven's Cultural Center had once been a luxury cruise ship's ballroom. Salvaged during the Acceleration phase, it now served as the floating city's premier gathering space. The windows framed a sea that swallowed the horizon, its surface glinting like shattered glass under the moon. The distant horizon blurred the boundary between sea and sky. Hovering service drones circulated with trays of food and drink, their humming barely audible beneath conversation and synthesized music.

Mira accepted champagne from a passing drone, using the motion to scan the room. The bubbles tickled her nose as she pretended to sip. Security was present but subtle, with Haven guards positioned at exits, their posture too rigid to be anything but military trained, surveillance systems disguised as decorative elements, lenses catching light at certain angles, and weapons scanners integrated into entry archways. She'd passed through those scanners with confidence, carrying nothing that would trigger alerts.

Her most dangerous weapon wasn't metal or plastic. It was the water itself, responding to her will in ways Haven security couldn't detect. Even now, she felt the champagne in her glass, the moisture in the air, the ocean beyond the windows, all singing to her blood.

"Fascinating choice of accessory," said a voice beside her. "Most consultants opt for something more... conventional."

Mira turned to find a tall man studying the pendant she wore, a small vial containing water, suspended from a simple silver chain. His attire was understated by Haven standards, a well-cut suit in deep blue with minimal illumination along the cuffs. His features were striking: strong jawline, gray-green eyes that observed with unusual intensity, and a small scar along his left jaw.

She recognized him immediately from her research. Elian Reeves, heir to Oceanic Solutions. Son of her target. Her heart stuttered before settling into a controlled rhythm.

"Convention is overrated," Mira replied, touching the pendant briefly. "This contains water from the Mediterranean Basin, one of the few samples taken before the salinity shift of 2097."

Elian studied her pendant, his smile tight. "An interesting prop, Dr. Voss. I'll expect more than academic flair tomorrow."

Mira nodded, maintaining the poised demeanor she'd practiced for weeks. "And you're Elian Reeves. Your company's desalination technology is referenced in most of my research papers."

"For better or worse," he said with a self-deprecating smile that didn't quite reach his eyes.

An interesting response. Not the corporate pride she'd expected from Oceanic Solutions' heir.

"The technology works," Mira said, watching him carefully, noting how he shifted away from a passing Council member. "Though I have questions about the discharge management protocols."

"As do I." Elian glanced around before continuing in a lower voice, leaning closer. "The hypersaline outflow is creating dead zones that our public reports don't acknowledge. I've been pushing for containment systems, but cost-benefit analyses keep delaying implementation."

Mira allowed genuine surprise to show. This wasn't the company line. Either Elian Reeves was testing her, or he was more complicated than her intelligence suggested.

"Cost-benefit analyses have a poor track record with environmental issues," she said. "We calculated the 'acceptable costs' of carbon emissions for a century. Now we live on the ocean instead of beside it."

Something shifted in Elian's expression, a flash of what might have been respect, a momentary dropping of guards. Before he could respond, a chime sounded through the atrium, silencing conversations as it indicated the formal program would begin.

"It seems we're being summoned to the presentation," he said, voice carrying a hint of reluctance. "Would you join me, Dr. Voss? I'd appreciate your perspective on what's about to be discussed."

This was unexpected, an opportunity to remain close to a Reeves without manufacturing a reason. Mira nodded, following Elian toward the central dais where Haven Council members assembled.

The crowd thrummed, their eyes glinting with a hunger for something solid. Council members and corporate executives claimed front positions, posture radiating entitlement. Their direct reports formed a second tier, attentive and eager. Various specialists, consultants, and lesser executives, including Mira in her current disguise, occupied the third ring. Security personnel remained at the perimeter, hands clasped behind backs in identical poses.

Victor Reeves stepped forward, his voice a blade she'd heard in nightmares since New Valencia. In person, he was more imposing than in images Mira had studied, tall and straight-backed despite his sixty-three years, with silver hair and the same strong jawline as his son. His eyes, however, were different, cold and calculating where Elian's held complexity, like frozen lakes rather than living forests.

Mira lingered at the edge, her crossed arms a wall against their sidelong glances. Her ribs clenched, his face scraping at buried scars.

Councilor Diaz, the current head of the Haven governing body, stepped forward. Her voice carried effortlessly across the atrium, enhanced by subtle audio technology. "Distinguished guests, we've gathered to discuss the Environmental Stability Initiative and its implications for our continued prosperity."

The presentation that followed was carefully crafted propaganda. Councilor Diaz outlined Haven achievements in "managing" the post-flood world, including desalination systems, floating agricultural platforms, and energy generation. Each point accompanied by holographic visualizations showing Haven benevolence extending to Tide Dweller communities and select Drowned settlements. The images glowed with artificial beauty, sanitized versions of the grim reality Mira knew firsthand.

What went unmentioned was the resource extraction, the exploitation of labor, the military enforcement of Haven territorial claims.

Mira maintained her professional mask, occasionally nodding at appropriate moments, jaw muscles tightening with each half-truth. Beside her, Elian Reeves watched with an expression that revealed nothing, though his fingers tapped an irregular rhythm against his thigh.

"Our next phase," Councilor Diaz continued, voice swelling with practiced inspiration, "involves expanded stability operations in sectors previously considered non-viable. Oceanic Solutions has developed breakthrough technology central to this initiative. Mr. Reeves, would you share an overview?"

The air tightened as Victor claimed the stage, a current rippling through the crowd. The crowd split, peeling back from his path. "Thank you, Councilor. For decades, we've adapted to the world the flood created. Now, we're preparing to take a more active role in shaping that world."

He activated a holographic display showing ocean current patterns, blue and white lines swirling above the audience's heads. "Project Watershed represents the culmination of research dating back to pre-flood era. Using targeted energy fields, we can modify deep ocean currents that drive surface conditions."

The display shifted to show underwater installations, metal and glass structures anchored to the ocean floor. "These modulation stations, placed at key points in global current systems, will allow unprecedented control over regional climate patterns. Areas currently uninhabitable due to hyperstorms could be stabilized. Agricultural yields could be increased by optimizing rainfall distribution."

A chill crawled up Mira's arms, sharp and unbidden. This aligned with the anomalous current patterns Dr. Reyes had mentioned, but the scale was far greater than she'd imagined. They weren't just testing; they were implementing. Her fingers found her pendant, clutching it through fabric.

"The first modulation station is already operational in the North Pacific Trench," Victor continued, his words glided, each one polished to pull them in. "Initial results have exceeded projections. With Council approval, we'll begin construction of the Atlantic and Indian Ocean stations within six months."

The implications staggered her. Control of ocean currents meant control of global weather patterns. Control of weather meant control of food production, habitability, survival itself.

"Questions will be addressed at tomorrow's technical briefing," Councilor Diaz announced as Victor concluded. "For now, please enjoy the remainder of the evening."

As the formal presentation ended, the gathering dissolved back into social clusters. Mira turned to Elian, whose expression had grown more guarded during his father's presentation.

"Your father didn't mention the ecological impact assessments," she said, testing his reaction. "Manipulating ocean currents at that scale would have cascading effects on marine ecosystems."

Elian's eyes met hers, and for a moment, Mira glimpsed something unexpected, concern, possibly even alarm, quickly masked. His voice lowered, meant only for her.

"The assessments are ongoing," he said carefully. "As Project Director, I've insisted on comprehensive modeling before full implementation."

This was new information. Elian wasn't just the corporate heir; he was directly involved with Project Watershed.

"You're the director?" Mira allowed her professional interest to show. "I'd be very interested in reviewing those models. My work on post-flood marine adaptation might provide useful baseline data."

Before Elian could respond, a security officer approached. "Mr. Reeves, your father requests your presence."

Elian dipped his head, a quiet tilt of alliance. "It seems duty calls, Dr. Voss. But I'm intrigued by your offer." He retrieved a small card from his jacket and handed it to her, fingers brushing against hers. "My private contact. The project could benefit from external expertise not filtered through corporate protocols."

Mira accepted the card, concealing her surprise. The thin metal was warm from his body heat.

"I look forward to continuing our discussion," she said, slipping the card into a hidden pocket.

Elian held her gaze a moment longer than necessary, something unspoken passing between them. "As do I. There's more to discuss than can be covered at a gathering like this."

As he walked away, following the security officer through the crowd, Mira considered the implications. Elian Reeves was either setting a trap, testing a suspicious consultant before reporting her, or he was genuinely concerned about his father's project. Either possibility complicated her plans.

She circulated through the gathering for another hour, gathering snippets of conversation about Project Watershed while maintaining her cover. The Haven elite spoke freely around her, assuming a mere consultant posed no threat. Their voices grew louder with alcohol, inhibitions lowering with each glass.

"The resource allocation is unprecedented," one executive murmured, breath heavy with expensive whiskey. "Three Haven sectors have had power reductions to fuel the first station."

"Worth it if it works," his companion replied, jewelry clinking as she gestured. "Imagine controlling where storms hit. Which regions get rain. We'd have leverage over every remaining land government."

"Victor's been obsessed with this for years. Ever since Sophia's death." The words were followed by a meaningful look that Mira filed away.

She drifted to another conversation, movements casual.

"The Tide Caller incidents are increasing," a security official was saying, voice carrying military precision. "Three confirmed captures last month, but at least five escaped detection."

"They're organizing," another replied, hand resting near a concealed weapon. "Intelligence suggests some kind of network operating through Tidefall."

"The new scanning technology should help. Can't hide altered DNA forever." The words sent a chill down Mira's spine.

Mira moved on, expression betraying nothing while her mind catalogued each piece of information. New scanning technology for Tide Callers. Power redirected from Haven sectors. Victor's personal investment in Project Watershed.

And Elian Reeves, the project's director, seemingly at odds with his father's vision.
