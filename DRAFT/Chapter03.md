# Chapter 3: The Discovery

The marketplace at Tidefall never truly slept. Even in pre-dawn hours, the trading hub maintained a persistent hum of activity. Salvagers returned from night expeditions, faces haggard but eyes bright. Food vendors prepared for morning rush, scent of frying kelp and cultivated fish cutting through salt air. Tide Dweller maintenance crews repaired countless systems keeping the repurposed structures afloat, quiet curses echoing when corroded connections refused to yield.

Mira navigated through this quieter marketplace with practiced ease. Her collection bag, disguised as ordinary salvage, hung heavily from her shoulder, the quantum drive pressing against her hip with each step.

She approached a nondescript stall wedged between a kelp noodle vendor and a reclamation specialist. Despite unremarkable appearance, Kai's trading post was one of Tidefall's most valuable information exchanges. The man himself sat behind his counter, fingers dancing across three different data tablets, blue glow illuminating deep lines around his eyes.

"You're late," he said without looking up. "Drone patrol?"

"Off-schedule sweep," Mira confirmed, setting her bag on the counter. "Someone changed the patterns without updating the public logs."

Kai looked up, dark eyes narrowing beneath salt-stiffened hair. At forty-something, his face carried the weathered look of someone who'd survived the worst of the Deluge as a child—skin toughened by sun and salt, a scar running from temple to jaw.

"Third time this month," he whispered. "Haven security's getting creative. Or desperate."

Mira nodded toward her bag. "Let's talk inside."

Kai glanced around before tapping a sequence on his counter. A section of floor behind his stall slid open with a hydraulic hiss, revealing a narrow staircase descending below the waterline.

The room below contrasted starkly with the weathered stall above. Clean, well-lit, packed with technology that would make Haven engineers envious. The air hummed with cooling systems and data processors. Kai's true business—information brokerage and authentication of salvaged tech—required equipment far beyond most Tide Dwellers' access.

Mira placed her bag on the examination table and extracted the quantum drive. Kai let out a low whistle, calloused fingers hovering over the device.

"Oceanic Solutions QS-7 model. Pre-flood. Where did you find this beauty?"

"Old financial district. Data storage company headquarters." Mira watched as Kai placed the drive in a diagnostic cradle. "Can you access it?"

"Maybe." His fingers flew across the terminal, keys clicking. "These units were designed to withstand extreme conditions. Self-contained power cells, triple-redundant storage matrices. If the seals held..." He trailed off, focused on his work.

Mira paced the small room. Her boots scuffed against metal floor, sound echoing in confined space. Her mind returned to the off-schedule drone patrol. Haven security didn't change patterns randomly.

"Interesting," Kai murmured, voice tinged with surprise.

Mira turned. "You got in?"

"Partial access. Primary storage is encrypted, but diagnostic partition is readable." Kai's eyes reflected blue screen glow. "This drive belonged to the Sofia Institute for Climate Research."

The name sent a jolt through Mira. "The Sofia Institute? Are you sure?"

Kai nodded, tapping the screen. "Their digital signature is all over the diagnostic logs. Last access date... March 2063."

Mira moved beside him, staring at the screen. The Sofia Institute had been legendary among environmental scientists—including her parents. Founded in the 2050s, it had produced the most accurate climate models of the pre-flood era. Models that had predicted the Acceleration phase with frightening precision.

Models dismissed as "alarmist" by the corporations now controlling Haven cities.

"Can you decrypt the main storage?" Mira asked, fingers digging into the table edge.

Kai gave her a sidelong glance. "This isn't just about salvage value for you, is it?"

Mira hesitated. Kai was as close to a friend as she allowed herself, but she compartmentalized her life by necessity. Her salvage work. Her revenge mission. Her Tide Caller identity. Separate boxes, rarely opened.

"My parents worked with the Sofia Institute," she said finally. "Before the Acceleration. Their research was suppressed, warnings ignored. When flooding worsened, they were among scientists trying to evacuate coastal communities." Her throat tightened. "They didn't make it out themselves."

Understanding dawned in Kai's eyes. "And you think this drive might contain evidence of who suppressed their research."

"It's possible." Mira tapped the drive's casing. "The Sofia Institute was mysteriously acquired and dissolved in late 2063. Their research vanished. Scientists scattered—or disappeared."

Kai turned back to his terminal, fingers moving with renewed purpose. "Decryption will take time. These quantum storage systems used cutting-edge security protocols. I'll need to build a custom cracking algorithm."

"How long?"

"Days, maybe weeks." He glanced up at her frown. "I can give you preliminary results sooner. The encryption likely has layers—less sensitive data might be accessible before core files."

Mira nodded. "Do what you can. I'll pay double your usual rate."

Kai waved this off. "Keep your credits. This one's personal." His expression darkened. "My family lived in Bangladesh. The Acceleration took everything. If this drive contains evidence against those responsible..." His jaw tightened.

A chime sounded from above—someone entering Kai's stall.

"Go," he said, moving toward the stairs. "Use the back exit. I'll contact you when I have something."

Mira squeezed his shoulder before slipping through a narrow doorway into a service corridor. The door closed behind her as Kai ascended to greet his customer, voice shifting effortlessly into his public persona.

The service corridor connected to Tidefall's maintenance network—a labyrinthine system running through repurposed structures. The air hung damp and cool, smelling of mildew and machine oil. Originally designed for university maintenance staff, these corridors now served engineers and technicians keeping the floating settlement functioning.

Mira's credentials identified her as an oceanographic researcher with maintenance access—a cover identity carefully constructed over years.

She emerged near the residential section where her small apartment was located. The eastern sky lightened, painting endless ocean in shades of pink and gold. Mira paused at a viewing platform, watching sunrise. The breeze carried salt and algae scent, ruffling her hair.

She continued to her apartment—a modest space reflecting her cover identity. Oceanographic instruments and research materials occupied most surfaces. Books on marine biology and climate science filled shelves.

After securing her door, Mira pressed her palm against a section of wall. A hidden compartment slid open with a soft click, revealing her real work. Maps marking corporate executives' locations. Salvaged documents connecting companies to climate research suppression. Profiles of Haven security protocols and vulnerabilities.

And at the center, a faded photograph of her family—Mira at twelve, flanked by her parents outside the university where they'd taught. Their last photo together, taken weeks before the evacuation that separated them forever.

Mira added a note about the Sofia Institute drive to her encrypted journal, then closed the compartment. She stripped off her salvage clothes and stepped into her shower, letting rationed water wash away the dive's physical remnants.

As water flowed over her skin, she felt the familiar connection—molecules responding to her presence, movement aligning with her breathing. She allowed herself this small indulgence before shutting off the flow.

A notification chimed from her comm unit. Mira wrapped herself in a towel and checked the message.

From: Dr. Reyes
Subject: Urgent consultation
Need your expertise on anomalous current patterns. My office, 0900 today.
Found something you should see.

Dr. Reyes—one of the few surviving scientists from her parents' generation. His hands shook with age, but his mind remained sharp. Officially, he consulted on her oceanographic research. Unofficially, he provided historical context and connections absent from Haven-controlled archives.

If he'd found something urgent enough to risk an early morning message, it was significant.

Mira dressed quickly in practical Tide Dweller researcher clothing—durable fabric in muted blues and grays, multiple pockets for instruments, weathered waterproof boots. She braided her dark hair, weaving in subtle blue strands that marked her to other Tide Callers without alerting Haven authorities.

Morning crowds thickened as she made her way through Tidefall's central marketplace. The massive spiral sculpture that once graced the university's courtyard now served as the hub's centerpiece. Tide Dwellers, Haven visitors, and even some Drowned with trading permits converged here.

Haven security drones hovered at the marketplace perimeter, cameras constantly scanning for prohibited technology, unregistered Tide Callers, or signs of dissent.

Dr. Reyes's office was located in what had once been the university's marine science building—now repurposed as a research center serving Haven interests while maintaining academic independence veneer. The elderly scientist hunched over a holographic display when she arrived, blue light accentuating liver spots on his hands.

"Close the door," he said without looking up, voice carrying the rasp of too many years breathing recycled air.

Mira complied, noting unusual tension in his voice. "What's wrong?"

Dr. Reyes activated a small device on his desk—a signal jammer, illegal for civilians. "I received a message yesterday. From an old colleague I thought was dead." He gestured to the holographic display. "She sent me this."

The display showed a corporate memo, its header bearing the logo of Oceanic Solutions—one of the largest corporations to survive the Deluge.

"Victor Reeves," she whispered, name bitter on her tongue.

"Yes." Dr. Reyes's voice turned grim. "The same Victor Reeves who led the corporate coalition that discredited the Sofia Institute's research. The same who acquired and dissolved the Institute in 2063."

He leaned forward, chair creaking. "And the same Victor Reeves who personally ordered the destruction of evacuation vessels during the New Valencia crisis."

Mira gripped the table edge, her face cold as if the blood had already drained to her boots. "New Valencia? You mean—"

"Your parents' evacuation fleet. Yes." Dr. Reyes's eyes held sorrow and rage, undiminished by time. "I never told you because I couldn't prove it. But my colleague has evidence. Documentation that Oceanic Solutions security forces were instructed to prevent 'unauthorized evacuations' from coastal areas with their research facilities."

"They picked who lived," Mira said, her voice a scraped whisper, "just to save their damn secrets."

"And to silence scientists who knew too much." Dr. Reyes nodded, thin hands trembling. "New Valencia housed three research facilities with data that could have implicated major corporations in climate crimes. When sea walls failed ahead of schedule, the evacuation became... inconvenient."

Her thoughts spun, jagged edges snagging on one risk after another. The Sofia Institute. Victor Reeves. Oceanic Solutions. The quantum drive in Kai's possession.

"I need to see this evidence," she said, voice steadier than she felt.

"My colleague is cautious. She's been hiding for decades." Dr. Reyes wrote coordinates on paper—untraceable. His pen scratched across the surface. "Meet her here, tomorrow at midnight. Come alone, and make certain you're not followed."

Mira memorized the coordinates before destroying the paper between her fingers. "Who is she?"

Dr. Reyes hesitated, fear flickering across his face. "She was the Sofia Institute's lead researcher. The one who developed the models that predicted everything—the Acceleration, the Deluge, all with frightening accuracy." He swallowed. "Her name is Dr. Sophia Reeves."

Mira's eyes widened. "Reeves? As in—"

"Victor's wife. Yes." Dr. Reyes's expression grew grimmer. "Officially, she died of a rare illness nineteen years ago. In reality, she faked her death after discovering what her husband had done. She's been gathering evidence ever since."

"Why now?"

"Because of Project Watershed." Dr. Reyes deactivated the signal jammer. In a more normal tone, he continued, "Those current anomalies I mentioned? They're not natural. Oceanic Solutions is testing something in deep ocean trenches. Something that could alter global water patterns."

He handed her a data drive disguised as an oceanographic instrument. "Study these readings carefully, Ms. Voss. I believe you'll find them quite illuminating for your research."

Mira understood the return to their cover conversation. She took the drive, the edges biting deeper as the truth sank in. "Thank you, Dr. Reyes. I'll analyze these right away."
