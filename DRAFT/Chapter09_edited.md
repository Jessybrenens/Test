# Chapter 9: The Confession

Elian's private office occupied a small section of the administrative level, its design more functional than the luxurious spaces typically reserved for Haven executives. A desk fabricated from recycled materials dominated one side, while the opposite wall featured a viewport offering a different perspective of the ocean than the observation deck, deeper, darker, the pressure more evident in the way light behaved at this depth.

Mira entered cautiously, scanning for exits and potential threats. The room contained standard office equipment, a small seating area, and environmental monitoring displays. Nothing overtly dangerous, though the door sliding closed behind them sent a flicker of unease through her chest.

Elian moved to his desk and activated a small device embedded in its surface. A subtle hum filled the room, barely perceptible but unmistakable to Mira's heightened senses.

"Signal dampening field," he explained. "Blocks all standard surveillance. My father believes it's for conducting sensitive corporate business. In reality..." He gestured toward a hidden panel that slid open to reveal a separate terminal. "I've been conducting my own investigation for years."

Mira maintained her distance, positioning herself where she could watch both Elian and the door. "You said you have evidence about New Valencia."

"I do." Elian studied her, his expression a complex mixture of caution and what might have been hope. "But first, I need to know who I'm really talking to. Are you Mira Voss, daughter of Elena and David Voss?"

The quiet thickened, a weight of things they wouldn't say. Mira touched her pendant, feeling the water respond to her tension. Partial truth might be her only viable option.

"Yes," she admitted finally. "My parents died at New Valencia."

"During the evacuation failure." Elian's voice cracked, feeling seeping past his guard. "Which wasn't a failure at all, but a deliberate action authorized by my father."

Mira's pulse quickened. "You know this for certain?"

"I've been piecing it together for years." Elian activated the hidden terminal, displaying a series of documents. "Internal memos, security directives, compensation records for personnel involved. Not enough for legal action, Haven controls the courts, but enough to confirm what happened."

The screen showed fragments of the same evidence Mira had just discovered in the archives, along with additional materials she hadn't accessed. Elian Reeves had been conducting his own investigation parallel to hers, accumulating proof of his father's crimes.

"Why?" Mira asked, the question encompassing more than she could articulate. Why would Victor Reeves's son gather evidence against him? Why reveal this to her now? Why risk everything for the truth?

Elian's gaze shifted to the viewport, to the darkness beyond. "My mother was a climate scientist. Sophia Reeves, founder of the Sofia Institute."

"I know who she was," Mira said carefully, watching his reaction.

"She died when I was fourteen. At least, that's what my father told me." Bitterness edged his voice. "A research vessel lost during a storm. No survivors, no bodies recovered. I accepted it for years, until I found inconsistencies in the official reports."

Mira remained silent, letting him continue. This was information Sophia hadn't shared, how her son had begun questioning the narrative of her death.

"I started looking into other 'accidents' involving climate researchers. New Valencia was the largest, but not the only one." Elian turned back to her. "Your parents were attempting to evacuate with research proving corporate responsibility for climate acceleration. Research that would have implicated Oceanic Solutions and other Haven corporations in crimes against humanity."

"And your father couldn't allow that," Mira said, the familiar cold anger settling in her chest.

"No. He authorized Operation Containment. Disabled the evacuation vessels' navigation systems, ensuring they couldn't leave the harbor before the sea wall failed." Elian's words spilled from him, rough-edged and unguarded. "Four thousand people sacrificed to protect corporate interests."

Mira studied him, searching for any sign of deception. "Why tell me this? Why risk exposing your own investigation?"

"Because you're here for the same reason I am." Elian's gaze locked onto hers. "To find evidence linking my father to climate crimes and expose the truth about Project Watershed."

The statement hung between them, a bridge across the gulf of suspicion. Mira weighed her options carefully. Complete honesty would mean revealing Sophia's survival, a disclosure that wasn't hers to make. But continuing to hide her true purpose would squander a potential alliance they might desperately need.

"I came to find evidence about New Valencia," she acknowledged. "And to investigate Project Watershed's environmental impact."

"But not as an oceanographic consultant." Elian's tone made it a statement rather than a question.

"No." Mira's spine straightened, a quiet strength locking into place. "Though my knowledge in that area is genuine."

"And you're a Tide Caller." Again, not a question.

Mira tensed, her hand moving instinctively toward her pendant. "What makes you say that?"

"The water responds to you differently than to others. Subtle changes in pressure and flow when you pass through certain areas of the station. Nothing obvious enough to trigger the standard detection systems, but noticeable to someone who's been studying Tide Caller phenomena."

His observation skills were sharper than she'd anticipated. "And yet you haven't reported me to security."

"I have no interest in supporting Haven's persecution of Tide Callers." Elian's expression hardened. "Another of my father's policies I disagree with."

Mira made a decision. Not complete disclosure, but enough truth to establish a working trust. "I'm part of a network investigating Haven's climate crimes and the potential dangers of Project Watershed. We have reason to believe the modulation technology is fundamentally flawed and could trigger catastrophic weather patterns if implemented globally."

"The boundary instabilities," Elian nodded. "They're worse than the official reports indicate. I've been falsifying data to buy time, but my father is accelerating the timeline for the Atlantic installation."

This was new information. "How soon?"

"Construction begins in three weeks. Once the second station comes online, the network effects will amplify any instabilities in the system." Elian's gaze dimmed, the truth casting a haze over his face. "We could see hyperstorm formation within months, not years as I originally calculated."

Mira absorbed this, recalculating timelines. Sophia's plan had assumed a longer window before the Atlantic installation became operational. "We need to stop it before construction begins."

"'We'?" Elian raised an eyebrow. "Who exactly are you working with, Mira?"

She hesitated, then offered a partial truth. "People who remember what the corporations did. Scientists, engineers, survivors from coastal regions. We've been gathering evidence for years."

"And now you need access to Project Watershed's core systems to prove the technology is flawed." Elian studied her with new intensity. "That's why you accepted my invitation to consult."

"Yes."

"What were you planning to do with the evidence once you had it?"

"Broadcast it throughout Haven and to remaining land governments. Force accountability for past crimes and prevent future catastrophe." Mira watched his reaction carefully. "Your father and the other Haven executives would face justice for their actions."

Elian absorbed this without visible emotion, though something flickered in his eyes, not surprise or outrage, but what might have been resignation. "And what would happen to Project Watershed?"

"Dismantled. The technology is too dangerous to exist, even with modifications."

He nodded slowly. "I've reached the same conclusion. The fundamental approach is flawed, trying to control natural systems rather than working with them." He gestured toward the terminal. "I've been developing an alternative approach based on distributed, smaller-scale interventions that support rather than override ocean current patterns."

Mira hadn't expected this level of alignment with their goals. "You'd help expose your own father? Destroy his legacy project?"

"My father destroyed his own legacy when he chose corporate profit over human lives." Elian's voice carried quiet conviction. "I've spent years trying to moderate his worst impulses from within the system. It hasn't worked. The time for half measures is past."

The declaration seemed genuine, but Mira maintained her caution. "Why should I trust you?"

"Not like you have to," he said, a wry twist to his mouth. "Just as I shouldn't trust someone who infiltrated this facility under false pretenses. But we appear to share common goals, and neither of us can achieve them alone."

He had a point. Mira needed access to systems that required his clearance level. And if his father truly was accelerating the timeline for expansion, they faced a more urgent deadline than Sophia had anticipated.

"What exactly are you proposing?" she asked.

"An alliance. I provide you access to the core systems and evidence about New Valencia. You share whatever you find with your network." Elian's gaze was steady. "Together, we expose the truth and prevent the Atlantic installation from proceeding."

It was essentially what Sophia had hoped for, Elian joining their effort willingly. But Mira still hesitated, aware of the complexities involved. "Your father will be implicated directly. He'll likely face criminal charges if we succeed."

"I know." His mouth twitched, a shadow crossing his face before his jaw set firm. "I made my peace with that possibility years ago, when I first found evidence of his involvement in New Valencia."

Mira studied him, searching for any sign of deception or hidden agenda. She found only determination and what appeared to be genuine ethical conviction. Either Elian Reeves was sincere in his opposition to his father's actions, or he was an exceptionally skilled actor.

"Alright," she said finally. "A provisional alliance. But I maintain contact with my network, and I make no promises about what happens to your father when this is over."

"Agreed." Elian extended his hand. "Though we should establish some ground rules for operational security."

Mira accepted the handshake, noting the firmness of his grip and the calluses that suggested he worked with his hands more than most Haven executives. "Such as?"

"No unauthorized system access. I can provide what you need without triggering security protocols." He released her hand. "And we should maintain our public roles, consultant and project director, to avoid suspicion."

"Reasonable," Mira agreed. "And we should limit direct meetings. Your father is already watching me."

"Yes, the security update was almost certainly aimed at you." Elian moved to the terminal, pulling up a station schematic. "We can use maintenance access point 17-B for exchanges if necessary. It's in a blind spot between surveillance zones."

His familiarity with the station's security vulnerabilities suggested this wasn't his first time operating outside official channels. "You've done this before," Mira observed.

A ghost of a smile touched his lips. "Let's just say I've had practice navigating around my father's surveillance systems."

The conversation was interrupted by a priority alert on Elian's official communication device. He checked it, his expression darkening.

"My father has called an emergency project review for 0800 tomorrow. All senior staff and consultants required to attend." He looked up at Mira. "He's going to announce the accelerated timeline for the Atlantic installation."

"Can you delay it?"

"Not without revealing my concerns about the boundary instabilities, which would only increase his suspicion." Elian's mind was clearly racing through options. "But this gives us an opportunity. While everyone is focused on the project review, we could access the core systems and extract the raw data on the instabilities."

Mira considered this. "We'd need a distraction to draw attention away from the system access."

"I can arrange that." Elian's expression shifted to something more determined. "There's a scheduled maintenance procedure for the external sensor array tomorrow. I can modify the parameters to trigger a minor alert, nothing dangerous, but enough to divert security attention."

The plan was taking shape, but Mira still had reservations. "What about your father? He'll be watching both of us."
