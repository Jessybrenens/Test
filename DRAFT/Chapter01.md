# Chapter 1: The Salvager

The water remembered what people forgot.

Mira Voss descended through murky green depths, currents sliding against her skin. At fifty meters, the ocean gripped her wetsuit, a weight she savored where others would choke.

She adjusted the small propulsion unit strapped to her left thigh, flinching as its vibrations hit a nerve. The modified Haven tech had cost her three months of salvage. Worth it. Her muscles ached, but her range extended, oxygen preserved.

The financial district loomed ahead, its towers like drowned giants, their glass eyes clouded with algae. Marine life had claimed these towers, coral bloomed across glass facades, algae draped from steel beams. Silver fish darted through shattered windows where executives once sat.

Mira checked her wrist display. Oxygen: 67%. Time: 14:23. Location: Grid sector 8-F. She pressed a hand to her chest, counting breaths against the forty-minute window before the drones returned.

She navigated toward a partially collapsed building, its corporate logo reduced to faded blue and white shapes. According to her research, this had been headquarters for a data storage company. Their server room might still contain salvageable components. Pre-flood tech fetched premium prices, enough to buy medicine for an entire Drowned settlement.

As she approached the shattered lobby, water shifted against her cheek. Not a natural current. Something large moved nearby.

She killed her propulsion unit and pressed against the algae-covered wall, slime cold and slick beneath her gloved fingers. Through green haze, a Haven security drone glided past, torpedo-shaped, scanning arrays where a nose should be. It moved with mechanical precision through the ruins.

Mira closed her eyes. The water spoke to her in pressure and temperature, in subtle movements and microscopic changes. She tracked the drone's path through disturbances it created, no need to see it.

The drone was off-schedule. Someone had changed patrol patterns without updating public logs.

Mira focused on the water surrounding her. The temperature around her body dropped two degrees, not enough to harm her in her insulated wetsuit, but enough to mask her thermal signature. Her skin prickled as cold seeped through protection.

The drone paused twenty meters away, sensors pulsing. Mira remained motionless, controlling her breathing. Her lungs burned. Muscles cramped. After what felt like eternity, the drone resumed its patrol, gliding away into murky distance.

She waited until she could no longer feel its presence before continuing. The building's interior formed a maze of collapsed walls and floating debris. A plastic astronaut toy drifted past her face, its faded smile eerie in the gloom. Mira navigated by memory, having studied old floor plans salvaged from a municipal database.

The server room would be on the third sublevel, accessible through what had once been an elevator shaft. She swam downward, headlamp cutting through decades of accumulated silt. The beam reflected off something metallic in the distance.

The server room door remained intact, electronic lock long dead. Mira retrieved a compact pry bar from her utility belt and wedged it into the door's seam. She applied leverage until the door groaned open, releasing a cloud of sediment that swirled around her.

She waited for the cloud to settle before entering. The room beyond stood frozen in time. Rows of server racks stood like tombstones, protected from the worst ocean corrosion by the room's reinforced design.

Mira moved through the room, examining each rack. Most would be worthless, circuits destroyed by saltwater. But occasionally, sealed units survived, data intact, processing cores viable. Those were worth a small fortune to the right buyers.

Her eye caught a promising candidate, a rack bearing the distinctive housing of quantum storage drives. These were rare even before the flood, designed to maintain data integrity under extreme conditions. If even one remained intact, this dive would pay for itself many times over.

She carefully extracted the drive unit, securing it in her reinforced collection bag. As she worked, her fingers brushed against her collarbone, an unconscious habit when alone. Scale-like birthmarks lay hidden beneath her wetsuit, their pattern familiar as her own reflection. The sign of a Tide Caller, her mother had whispered during those final days before evacuation.

A distant boom reverberated through water, vibrating through Mira's chest. She froze. Depth charges from Haven security, their method for clearing "unauthorized salvagers" from restricted areas. Not close enough to threaten her directly, but signaling increased activity in the sector.

Time to leave.

Mira secured her collection bag and exited the server room, taking a different route back. She stayed close to the building's exterior where coral growth would help mask her movement. A school of silver fish scattered at her approach, scales catching dim light.

As she ascended, water grew warmer and lighter. Crushing pressure eased. Mira's fingers twitched, reluctant to leave the depths where her abilities flowed naturally and boundaries between body and ocean blurred.

Her head broke the surface two kilometers from her entry point, in a secluded cove hidden from Haven surveillance. Salt stung her eyes as she blinked against sudden brightness. A small boat bobbed nearby, weathered hull camouflaged with algae and barnacles.

Mira pulled herself aboard and removed her breathing apparatus, gulping air that tasted of salt. Afternoon sun warmed her face as she secured her collection bag and started the boat's quiet electric motor. To any passing Haven patrol, she would appear to be just another Drowned scavenger collecting floating garbage.

They wouldn't look closely enough to see high-tech salvage hidden beneath decoy plastic waste. They wouldn't notice how water around her boat moved against prevailing current, speeding her journey.

Tidefall appeared on the horizon, a jumble of repurposed structures rising from the water. Mira's fingers traced the outline of the quantum drive through her bag. More than valuable technology. Possibly evidence. Another piece in her years-long puzzle.

Another step toward finding those responsible for her parents' death.

The boat cut through choppy waves, spray hitting her face. Despite her mask of calm, Mira pulsed with frenetic optimism. Her thoughts were consumed by the possibilities before her. If the drive contained what she hoped as she allowed her thoughts their wandering into territories of corporate communications, internal memos, and evacuation priorities, she'd be closer to proving what she'd always known: the flood wasn't natural disaster but calculated sacrifice.

The wealthy had known. They'd saved themselves. Left the rest to drown.

Including her parents.

Mira's hand tightened on the tiller. The water around her boat churned, responding to emotions she wouldn't allow herself to show. Justice or revenge, the line blurred more each day. But either way, the drive nestled in her bag might finally give her the weapon she needed.

And she knew exactly how to use it.
