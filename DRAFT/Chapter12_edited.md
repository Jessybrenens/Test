# Chapter 12: The Reunion

Sophia Reeves pressed her palm against the cold metal of the underwater access hatch, feeling the vibrations of the station through her fingertips. Nineteen years of hiding, of watching from the shadows as her husband twisted her research into something monstrous. Nineteen years since she'd seen her son.

The submersible that had brought her here rested twenty meters below, camouflaged against the ocean floor by adaptive plating. Her team had positioned it precisely at the junction of maintenance conduits 37-B and 42-C, a blind spot in the station's external sensor array that she herself had identified during the original design phase.

"Breach team reports communications disruption successful," Kai's voice came through her earpiece, distorted by the deep-water transmission protocols. "Station comms are experiencing cascading failures across all secure channels. They're switching to emergency systems now."

Sophia adjusted her rebreather mask, the familiar weight of it against her face a reminder of countless dives in waters that had once been coastlines. "Duration?"

"Forty minutes before their redundancies can compensate. Maybe less if they've upgraded the quantum encryption."

"Enough time." She turned to the three figures floating beside her, their specialized dive suits marking them as fellow members of the resistance. "Remember, non-lethal interventions only. These are technicians and scientists, not soldiers."

The tallest of them, a woman with intricate braids visible beneath her helmet, nodded. "We're clear on the objectives. Get you to the central hub, extract Elian Reeves, secure the modulation controls."

Sophia activated the bypass sequence on her wrist terminal, watching as the ancient access codes, maintenance overrides from the station's initial construction, attempted to penetrate the security system. For several seconds, nothing happened. Then the hatch's indicator light shifted from red to amber.

"They've changed some of the protocols," she murmured, fingers dancing across the interface as she adapted her approach. "But not the underlying architecture."

The light flashed green. The hatch unsealed with a soft hiss of equalizing pressure.

"We're in."

The maintenance shaft beyond the hatch was dimly lit by emergency lighting strips, their blue glow reflecting off the moisture-slick walls. Sophia moved with practiced efficiency, her body remembering the layout of a station she had helped design two decades earlier. The others followed, their movements precise and economical.

"Security alert in progress," Kai updated through the comm. "They're reporting multiple system failures across environmental controls and communications. Security teams are spread thin."

"Victor's work," Sophia replied, a hint of grim satisfaction in her voice. "He never could resist overreacting."

They reached the first junction, where the maintenance shaft intersected with a larger service corridor. Sophia paused, consulting the station schematic displayed on her wrist terminal. The detention level would be two sections forward, one level up.

"Elian's location?"

"Still processing," Kai responded. "Internal tracking systems are in flux. Last confirmed position was Maintenance Level 3, Section 17."

Sophia frowned. Not the executive level where she'd expected Victor to hold him, but a peripheral area near the external maintenance bays. Either Victor was being unusually cautious, or something else was happening.

"Change of plan," she decided. "We head for Maintenance Level 3 first."

The team adjusted their route, moving through the service corridors with the confidence of those who had studied the station's layout for months. Occasionally they passed station personnel hurrying to address the cascading system failures, but in their maintenance coveralls and with the station in emergency status, the team attracted little attention.

Sophia's chest tightened, her pulse quickening from years of dodging Victor's shadow. The pendant at her throat, containing a sample of water from her childhood home in Greece, now hundreds of meters underwater, seemed to pulse against her skin.

They reached the access point for Maintenance Level 3 without incident. The security panel beside the door showed active lockdown protocols, no entry without executive authorization.

"Kai, we need override access to Maintenance Level 3."

"Working on it. Their security systems are fighting back. Someone good is running countermeasures."

Sophia's lips curved in a slight smile. "That would be Dr. Nakamura. She always was brilliant with adaptive systems."

She removed a small device from her equipment belt, a specialized interface designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Haven security architecture. As she connected it to the panel, the screen flickered, lines of code scrolling rapidly as the device engaged with the security system.

"Tell me about the station status," she requested, eyes fixed on the changing display.

"Environmental systems showing instability in the modulation control sectors," Kai reported. "Power fluctuations in the primary reactor. They've initiated containment protocols in three sections due to pressure anomalies."

Exactly as predicted. The modulation technology was inherently unstable at this scale, creating harmonic resonances that the station's systems couldn't properly compensate for. Victor had ignored her warnings about this nineteen years ago. Now the evidence was manifesting.

The security panel beeped, its display shifting from red to green. The door slid open.

"We're through," Sophia announced, disconnecting her device. "Proceed with caution. If security is concentrated anywhere, it will be here."

The corridor beyond was eerily quiet, the usual background hum of station operations replaced by the intermittent wail of alert sirens. The corridors glowed faint, shadows twisting with each step she took.

Sophia consulted her wrist terminal, which displayed a thermal mapping of the level based on environmental sensor data Kai had accessed. A cluster of heat signatures appeared in Section 17, multiple individuals in what appeared to be a maintenance control room.

"Six people, approximately thirty meters ahead," she informed her team. "Four showing security thermal patterns, two civilians."

"Elian?" asked the woman with braided hair.

"Possibly." Sophia adjusted her equipment belt, ensuring her non-lethal deterrents were easily accessible. "We proceed with caution. Kai, can you access the security feeds for this section?"

"Negative. They've isolated the surveillance systems. Running on closed circuit."

Smart. Someone was thinking defensively, limiting digital access points. That suggested they were protecting something, or someone, valuable.

They moved forward, approaching the heat signatures with practiced stealth. As they neared the maintenance control room, voices became audible, tense, argumentative.

"Cannot hold him indefinitely without formal charges," a woman was saying, her tone professionally firm despite obvious stress. "The Project Director has authority that supersedes even security protocols."

"My orders come directly from Victor Reeves," a male voice responded, the clipped precision marking him as security personnel. "Director Elian Reeves is to remain in protective custody until his father returns to the station."

"Protective custody?" A new voice, younger, with controlled anger beneath the words. "Is that what we're calling it now, Chief Larson?"

Sophia's heart contracted painfully in her chest. Elian. Her son's voice, so similar to how Victor's had sounded when they first met, but with an undertone of something Victor had never possessed, genuine moral outrage.

She signaled to her team, indicating positions around the control room entrance. They moved silently into place, readying their non-lethal deterrents.

"Three," she mouthed silently. "Two. One."

They moved as a coordinated unit, entering the control room from multiple access points simultaneously. The security personnel reacted with professional speed, reaching for weapons, but the team's shock deterrents activated first, targeted electromagnetic pulses that temporarily disrupted neural pathways without causing permanent damage.

The four security officers collapsed, their muscles temporarily unresponsive. The two civilians, a woman in a scientist's uniform and a man in the distinctive attire of a Project Director, remained standing, shock evident on their faces.

Sophia stepped forward, removing her rebreather mask.

The air thickened as their eyes met, seconds stretching thin. She looked at her son, taller than she remembered, his features sharpened into adulthood, but with her eyes looking back at her from Victor's face.

"Hello, Elian," she said softly.

He stared at her, disbelief warring with recognition. "It's not possible," he whispered. "You died. The explosion at the Sofia Institute..."

"There was no accident." Sophia moved closer, fighting the urge to reach for him. "I discovered what your father was planning. What he'd done at New Valencia. I had to disappear to gather evidence, to build a resistance that could stop him."

Elian's face twisted, confusion, then shock, anger flaring before softening into a raw ache.

"Nineteen years," he said, his voice barely audible. "You let me believe you were dead for nineteen years."

The woman beside him, Dr. Nakamura, Sophia realized, recognizing her former student despite the years, placed a steadying hand on Elian's arm.

"Director Reeves," she said quietly, "the modulation field instabilities are increasing. We need to make a decision about emergency protocols."

Elian's eyes traced her, softening then narrowing in turn. "You're working with Mira Voss."

It wasn't a question. Sophia nodded. "She should have reached the rendezvous point by now. The data you helped her extract will be enough to stop the Atlantic installation."

"If there's still time," Dr. Nakamura interjected. "The instabilities in this station's modulation field are accelerating beyond predicted parameters. The system is approaching cascade failure."

The station jolted, a low growl rumbling from its heart. The lights flickered, emergency systems momentarily faltering.

"We need to reach the central control hub," Sophia said. "I can implement emergency shutdown protocols for the modulation field."

"Those protocols were removed from the system," Elian replied, his professional focus reasserting itself despite the emotional turmoil. "Father had them deleted after the last stability test showed potential vulnerabilities."

Sophia's expression hardened. "Of course he did. Always prioritizing control over safety." She turned to Dr. Nakamura. "What about manual override at the physical interface? The original design included mechanical failsafes."
