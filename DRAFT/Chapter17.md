# Chapter 17: Blood in the Water

The water pressed against Mira from all sides, the darkness of the flooded laboratory broken only by the faint emergency lights near the sealed door. Through the small viewport, she could see the security officer's retreating form, confident that Mira's fate was sealed.

Mira forced herself to remain calm, conserving oxygen as she assessed her situation. The laboratory was completely submerged now, the water still rising as it sought equilibrium with the ocean outside. Her diving gear would provide limited breathing time, perhaps an hour if she was careful. Not enough to wait for rescue.

She needed to find a way out, and quickly.

Focusing her Tide Caller senses, Mira extended her awareness through the water filling the laboratory. The currents were chaotic, disturbed by the rapid flooding, but beneath that turbulence she detected something else: a subtle flow pattern indicating water movement through the structure. Where water could flow out, she might be able to follow.

Swimming carefully through the darkness, Mira traced the current to its source: a maintenance conduit near the floor, partially hidden behind a fallen storage unit. The opening was small, barely wide enough for a person, but it represented her only chance of escape.

Mira wedged herself into the narrow passage, using her arms to pull herself forward through the tight space. The conduit twisted and turned, forcing her to contort her body to navigate its bends. Several times she became stuck, panic threatening to overwhelm her before she managed to wriggle free.

After what felt like an eternity, the conduit widened slightly, allowing easier movement. Mira's lungs burned despite her breathing apparatus, the exertion depleting her oxygen faster than anticipated. The darkness was absolute now, forcing her to rely entirely on touch and her Tide Caller senses to navigate.

Just as her strength began to wane, Mira felt a change in the water pressure. The conduit was sloping upward, leading toward what she hoped was an exit. With renewed determination, she pushed forward, following the gradient until her hands encountered a grate blocking the passage.

The grate was secured with bolts, but years of exposure to saltwater had corroded the metal. Mira braced herself against the sides of the conduit and pushed with all her remaining strength. For a terrifying moment nothing happened, then with a grinding sound that she felt rather than heard, the grate gave way.

Mira burst from the conduit into open water, the sudden freedom almost disorienting after the claustrophobic passage. She oriented herself quickly, recognizing that she had emerged from the side of the Haven facility, away from where the security team would be watching.

Her oxygen supply was dangerously low, the indicator on her gear flashing a warning. The surface was too far to reach before her air ran out. She needed another option.

The submersible. Selene would still be waiting, monitoring for her return. Mira activated her emergency beacon, a risk since it might alert the Haven security team, but necessary to guide Selene to her location.

Swimming with desperate speed, Mira moved away from the facility, putting distance between herself and her pursuers. The water around New Valencia was murky with sediment, providing some cover as she navigated by memory and instinct toward where she hoped Selene would be waiting.

Her lungs screamed for air, the last of her oxygen depleting as she pushed herself beyond normal human limits. Just as spots began to dance before her eyes, a powerful beam of light cut through the water ahead. The submersible.

Mira's relief was short-lived. Behind her, additional lights appeared, cutting through the murk. The Haven security team had detected her escape and was in pursuit, their superior equipment allowing them to move faster through the water.

With the last of her strength, Mira surged toward the submersible, her vision narrowing as oxygen deprivation took its toll. She could see the vessel's airlock opening, Selene's silhouette visible within, reaching out toward her.

Something sharp struck Mira's leg, sending a jolt of pain through her body. A harpoon, fired from one of the pursuing security team members, had grazed her calf, tearing through her diving suit. Blood clouded the water around her, the wound burning as saltwater invaded it.

Selene's hand closed around Mira's arm, pulling her into the submersible's airlock. The outer door sealed just as Mira's consciousness began to fade, the chamber filling with air as the water drained away.

"Mira! Stay with me!" Selene's voice seemed to come from a great distance as she removed Mira's breathing apparatus and checked her vital signs.

Mira gasped, drawing precious air into her starved lungs. The pain in her leg flared as Selene examined the wound, applying pressure to slow the bleeding.

"Haven security," Mira managed between ragged breaths. "They're coming."

"I know," Selene replied grimly, helping Mira into the submersible's main cabin. "We need to move now."

Through the viewport, Mira could see the lights of the pursuing security team growing closer. Selene took the controls, activating the submersible's engines and pulling away from New Valencia's ruins with a burst of speed that pressed Mira back against her seat.

"They're faster than us," Selene observed, her eyes on the sensor display showing multiple vessels in pursuit. "And they're armed."

As if to emphasize her point, something struck the submersible's hull with a metallic clang. Not a direct hit, but close enough to confirm the danger.

"We can't outrun them," Mira acknowledged, wincing as she secured a pressure bandage over her leg wound. "We need to outsmart them."

She studied the navigation display, considering their options. The open ocean offered no cover, making them easy targets. But the ruins of New Valencia itself might provide the advantage they needed.

"There," Mira pointed to a section of the submerged city where tall buildings created a dense underwater maze. "The old financial district. The buildings are close together, passages too narrow for their larger vessels."

Selene nodded, adjusting their course. "It's risky. Lots of debris, collapsed structures."

"Better than being shot out of the water," Mira replied, her voice steadier now as her breathing normalized. "I know these ruins. My father used to take me through the city, showing me the architecture."

The memory brought a fresh wave of anger and grief. The security officer's taunting words echoed in her mind: "I slit their throats myself, your father begged." The casual cruelty, the pride in her voice as she described murdering Mira's parents, ignited a rage that burned through the pain and exhaustion.

Selene guided the submersible into the labyrinth of submerged buildings, navigating with remarkable skill through narrow gaps and around dangerous debris. The pursuing vessels followed, but their larger size and less maneuverable design forced them to slow down, giving Mira and Selene a slight advantage.

"What happened in there?" Selene asked as they momentarily ducked into the hollow shell of what had once been a bank, hiding from the searchlights of their pursuers. "What did you find?"

Mira's hands trembled as she retrieved Victor's logbook from her waterproof pouch. "Evidence. Proof that Haven didn't just destroy New Valencia, they extracted specific people first. Including my mother."

Selene's eyes widened. "Your mother survived the destruction?"

"Only to suffer something worse," Mira replied, her voice tight with controlled fury. "They kept her as a research subject, experimenting on her Tide Caller abilities. For years."

She flipped through the logbook, showing Selene the damning entries. "Victor knew. He ordered it all, including their eventual elimination when they were no longer useful."

"But at the summit, he seemed genuinely remorseful," Selene said, confusion evident in her voice. "His confession, his cooperation..."

"A partial truth at best," Mira cut in. "He confessed to sacrificing New Valencia, yes. But not to the experiments that followed, not to keeping my mother alive as a test subject, not to her execution when she was no longer useful."

The submersible's proximity alarm sounded, warning of an approaching vessel. Selene quickly adjusted their position, moving deeper into the ruins to evade detection.

"There's more," Mira continued once they were temporarily safe. "The facility was evacuated just after the summit concluded. Victor's confession triggered a cleanup operation, eliminating evidence and any remaining subjects."

"Subjects?" Selene echoed, horror dawning in her expression. "There were others?"

"Other Tide Callers," Mira confirmed grimly. "I don't know how many or if any survived. But the woman I encountered, the security officer, she spoke as if she had personally been involved in both my parents' deaths."

The memory of the woman's cold smile, her casual cruelty, sent a fresh surge of rage through Mira. "She's still there, still hunting us. I need to go back, to capture her, make her tell me everything she knows."

"That's suicide," Selene objected, checking the sensors again. "There's an entire Haven security team up there, probably calling for reinforcements. We need to get this evidence back to Tidefall, let the Council decide how to proceed."

Mira knew Selene was right, but the thought of letting her parents' killer escape was almost unbearable. The woman's words had been deliberately provocative, designed to cause pain, but they also suggested she possessed knowledge that Mira desperately needed.

"Your mother didn't die," the woman had taunted. Was that merely cruelty, or could there be truth in it? Could Elena Voss somehow still be alive, perhaps held in another facility?

Before Mira could respond, a powerful impact rocked the submersible, sending them both lurching against their restraints. Warning lights flashed across the control panel.

"Direct hit," Selene reported, her fingers flying over the controls. "Hull integrity compromised in the aft section. We're taking on water."

Another impact followed, more devastating than the first. The submersible's main power failed, emergency systems activating with a dull red glow that bathed the cabin in blood-like light.

"We're losing propulsion," Selene announced, fighting with the now-unresponsive controls. "And the ballast systems are failing. We're going to sink."

Mira quickly assessed their situation. The submersible was designed with emergency protocols for just such a scenario, but those systems assumed a controlled descent to the seafloor, not a combat situation with hostile forces in pursuit.

"Can we reach the surface?" she asked, already knowing the answer.

Selene shook her head. "Not with the damage we've sustained. And they're above us now anyway." She pointed to the sensor display, which showed Haven vessels positioned to cut off any escape toward the surface.

"Then we go deeper," Mira decided. "Use the current emergency ballast release. We'll drop to the seafloor, fast enough that they might lose track of us in the debris cloud."

It was a desperate plan, but their only option. Selene activated the emergency release, and the submersible plummeted toward the ocean floor, the rapid descent pressing them into their seats with uncomfortable force.

The impact when they hit bottom was jarring despite the automated cushioning systems. Warning indicators showed multiple system failures, and water was now visibly seeping into the cabin from damaged seals.

"We need to abandon the submersible," Mira said, already reaching for the emergency diving gear stored beneath her seat. "The hull won't hold much longer."

Selene nodded grimly, retrieving her own gear. "The Haven team will be searching for us. We won't get far."

"We don't need to get far," Mira replied, securing Victor's logbook and the digital evidence she'd retrieved from the facility in a waterproof container. "Just far enough to hide until help arrives."

"Help?" Selene questioned, pausing in her preparations.

"Kai," Mira explained. "He said three days before sending a search team. It's been less than one. But he'll be monitoring for our emergency beacon." She tapped the device attached to her diving suit. "Once we're clear of the submersible, I'll activate it. The signal should reach Tidefall."

"And bring Haven down on us in the meantime," Selene pointed out.

"We'll have to take that risk," Mira acknowledged. "But first, we need to get away from here, find somewhere to hide."

They completed their preparations as water continued to fill the cabin, now reaching their knees. The submersible groaned around them, its structure compromised beyond recovery.

"Ready?" Mira asked, checking Selene's gear one final time.

Selene nodded, her expression resolute despite the fear evident in her eyes. "Where do we go?"

Mira considered their limited options. The ruins of New Valencia offered potential hiding places, but the Haven security team would expect that. They needed somewhere less obvious.

"The deep trench," she decided. "East of the city. It's too deep for standard diving equipment, but with our Tide Caller abilities, we can manage it. They won't expect us to go that way."

The plan was risky. The trench Mira referred to plunged to depths that would crush normal diving equipment, and even with their Tide Caller resistance to pressure, they would be pushing the limits of human endurance. But it offered their best chance of evading pursuit.

"Let's go," Selene agreed, moving toward the airlock.

The process of exiting the sinking submersible was tense but methodical. They cycled through the airlock one at a time, Selene going first while Mira secured the evidence and prepared the submersible's self-destruct sequence, a last resort to prevent Haven from recovering any data from its systems.

Once outside, they swam quickly away from the stricken vessel, using the cover of the sediment cloud their impact had created. Above them, the lights of Haven vessels swept back and forth, searching for signs of survivors.

Mira led the way toward the eastern edge of New Valencia, where the continental shelf dropped away into the deep trench. They moved cautiously, using the ruins for cover whenever possible, their progress slow but steady.

They had almost reached the trench when a powerful spotlight caught them, illuminating their figures against the darkness of the deep water. A Haven vessel had spotted them and was closing fast.

"Go!" Mira urged Selene, pushing her toward the trench. "I'll draw them off!"

Before Selene could protest, Mira swam in the opposite direction, deliberately making herself visible to the pursuing vessel. The tactic worked; the spotlight followed her, and the vessel changed course to intercept.

Mira pushed her Tide Caller abilities to their limit, manipulating the water currents around her to increase her speed. But the Haven vessel was faster, gaining on her with every moment. A harpoon shot past her, missing by inches, followed by another that grazed her shoulder, sending a fresh bloom of blood into the water.

Just as the vessel was about to overtake her, Mira felt a sudden, powerful current surge from below, a vortex of water that caught the Haven vessel and spun it violently. Selene had not fled as instructed but had instead circled back, using her own Tide Caller abilities to create the disruptive current.

The Haven vessel's spotlight swung wildly as it fought to stabilize, giving Mira and Selene the moment they needed to dive deeper, toward the trench. More vessels were converging on their position, alerted by the first's distress signals.

As they descended into the darkness of the trench, the pressure increased dramatically, squeezing their bodies despite their Tide Caller resistance. Normal humans would have been crushed at this depth, their equipment failing catastrophically. Even for Tide Callers, it was dangerous territory.

"We can't stay down here long," Selene warned, her voice distorted by the communication system in their diving gear. "The pressure is too great, even for us."

Mira nodded her understanding. They needed to find a temporary sanctuary, somewhere to hide until the immediate pursuit passed and they could risk activating their emergency beacon.

The trench walls were riddled with caves and crevices, formed by ancient geological processes and now home to strange deep-sea creatures adapted to the crushing pressure. Mira led them toward one such cave, its entrance partially concealed by peculiar, luminescent coral that cast an eerie blue glow over the surrounding water.

Inside, the cave extended deeper into the trench wall, creating a natural chamber large enough for them to rest. The water here was unnaturally still, isolated from the currents outside, creating a pocket of relative calm in the hostile environment.

"We should be safe here, at least for a while," Mira said, checking her equipment. The wound on her leg had stopped bleeding, but her shoulder injury from the second harpoon continued to seep blood despite the pressure bandage she had applied.

Selene examined the injury with concern. "It's deep. You've lost a lot of blood."

"I'll manage," Mira replied, though the lightheadedness she felt suggested otherwise. "We need to conserve oxygen and wait for the search to move on before we try to surface."

They settled into an uneasy wait, monitoring their oxygen levels and listening for any signs of pursuit. The strange luminescence from the coral provided just enough light to see each other's faces, both marked with exhaustion and tension.

After what seemed like hours but was likely much less, Selene broke the silence. "What you found in that facility... about your mother. Do you think there's any chance she could still be alive?"

The question had been haunting Mira since her encounter with the security officer. The woman's taunt—"Your mother didn't die. She's rotting in Haven's black site, a lab rat now"—could have been merely psychological torture. But what if it contained a kernel of truth?

"The records I found indicated she was terminated five years ago," Mira said slowly. "But Haven has lied about everything else. Why not this too?"

The possibility that her mother might still be alive somewhere, still suffering as a research subject, was almost too painful to contemplate. Yet Mira couldn't dismiss it entirely.

"If there's even the slightest chance," she continued, her voice hardening with resolve, "I have to find out. I have to know the truth."

Selene nodded, understanding in her eyes. "We'll find out together. But first, we need to survive this and get back to Tidefall."

A sudden disturbance in the water outside their hiding place silenced their conversation. Something large was moving near the cave entrance, disturbing the peculiar stillness of the trench.

Mira signaled for silence, extinguishing their lights. In the faint glow of the luminescent coral, they watched as a shadow passed across the cave entrance, too large to be a natural predator of the deep.

A Haven diving suit, specially designed for extreme depths. The security team had followed them into the trench.

Mira and Selene pressed themselves against the back wall of the cave, hoping the coral's glow would not betray their presence. The diver paused at the entrance, sweeping a powerful light across the interior. For a heart-stopping moment, the beam passed directly over their position, but the diver apparently failed to distinguish their forms from the irregular cave walls.

After what felt like an eternity, the diver moved on, continuing along the trench wall in search of them. Mira released the breath she had been holding, the relief momentary as she realized their situation remained dire.

"They're searching methodically," she whispered. "It's only a matter of time before they find us."

"We need to move," Selene agreed. "But where? We can't go deeper, and if we head toward the surface, we'll be exposed."

Mira considered their limited options. The trench extended for miles in either direction, but staying within it meant remaining trapped between the searching divers and the crushing depths below. Their oxygen supplies were dwindling, and Mira's injuries were taking their toll, her strength ebbing with each passing minute.

"We need to create a diversion," she decided. "Something to draw them away long enough for us to make it to shallower water where we can activate the emergency beacon."

Before Selene could respond, a powerful tremor shook the cave, dislodging fragments of rock from the ceiling. Another followed, stronger than the first, the vibrations traveling through the water with disorienting intensity.

"What is that?" Selene asked, alarm evident in her voice.

Mira felt it through her Tide Caller senses, a massive disturbance in the water far above them. "Something's happening on the surface. Some kind of explosion or impact."

More tremors followed, the pattern suggesting a series of detonations. The Haven security team was using depth charges, trying to flush them out or kill them outright.

"We need to move, now!" Mira urged, already heading for the cave entrance. "The charges will get closer, more precise. They're willing to collapse the entire trench to eliminate us."

They swam from their hiding place, keeping close to the trench wall for whatever minimal protection it might offer. Above them, they could see the flashes of explosions, feel the pressure waves radiating outward from each detonation.

A particularly powerful charge exploded closer than the others, the shock wave slamming into them with stunning force. Mira felt herself tumbling through the water, disoriented and separated from Selene. Her vision blurred, ears ringing despite her diving gear's protection.

When she regained her senses, she found herself alone, having been driven deeper into the trench by the explosion. Panic surged as she searched for Selene, finally spotting her friend's form drifting limply several meters away.

Mira swam to her with desperate speed, finding Selene unconscious, her diving mask cracked but miraculously still maintaining its seal. Blood trickled from her nose and ears, signs of internal injuries from the pressure wave.

Cradling Selene's unconscious form, Mira faced an impossible choice. They couldn't remain in the trench with the depth charges continuing to fall. But Selene was in no condition to swim to safety, and Mira couldn't carry her the distance required to reach shallower water.

The decision was made for her when a Haven diver appeared above them, weapon raised. Mira recognized the distinctive scarred face visible through the diving mask: the security officer from the facility, the woman who had taunted her about her parents' deaths.

The woman's cold smile was visible even through her specialized diving gear as she aimed her weapon at Mira. But instead of firing, she activated a communication device, her voice carrying through the water to Mira's receiver.

"Daughter of Elena Voss," the woman said, her tone conversational despite the circumstances. "You're as stubborn as your mother. She held out for years, refusing integration, refusing to cooperate. Always believing someone would come for her."

Mira's heart pounded, the woman's words confirming what she had begun to suspect. "My mother is alive."

The security officer's laugh was chilling. "Was alive. Until recently. Your father died in New Valencia, yes. But your mother, with her unique Tide Caller genetics, was far too valuable to waste."

"Where is she?" Mira demanded, still supporting Selene's unconscious form while trying to maintain a defensive posture.

"Haven's primary research facility. The black site where all the special projects happen." The woman adjusted her weapon, keeping it trained on Mira. "Or rather, that's where she was. After your friend Victor's inconvenient attack of conscience, certain operations had to be... relocated."

Another depth charge exploded, this one far enough away to merely rock them rather than cause damage. The woman seemed unconcerned by the danger, confident in her specialized equipment's ability to withstand the pressure and impacts.

"You're lying," Mira said, though doubt crept into her voice. "The records I found indicated she was terminated five years ago."

"Official records," the woman corrected with evident amusement. "Haven has always maintained two sets of books. Your mother's Tide Caller abilities were unique, even among her kind. The neural integration research was too valuable to terminate, despite her continued resistance."

The revelation sent Mira's thoughts spinning. If her mother truly was alive, had been alive all these years while Mira believed her dead, the implications were staggering. The hope that surged through her was almost painful in its intensity.

"Where is she now?" Mira demanded again, her voice hardening.

The security officer's smile widened. "Bring me Victor Reeves, and perhaps I'll tell you. Haven is particularly interested in having a conversation with our former director about his recent change of heart."

"You expect me to believe you'd honor such a deal?" Mira scoffed, buying time as she assessed their situation. The woman was between them and the path to shallower water, but appeared to be alone, at least for the moment.

"Believe what you want," the woman replied with a shrug. "But consider this: I could kill you both right now. The fact that I'm offering an alternative suggests I'm telling the truth about your mother."

Another depth charge detonated, closer this time, the shock wave momentarily disrupting their position. The security officer recovered first, her weapon still trained on Mira.

"Time's running out," she said. "My team will reach this position soon. Make your choice."

In that moment, Mira felt Selene stir against her, regaining consciousness. Their eyes met briefly, a silent communication passing between them. Selene's hand moved subtly, indicating she was ready to act.

"I have a counter-offer," Mira said, keeping the security officer's attention focused on her. "You tell me where my mother is, and I don't kill you right now."

The woman laughed. "Bold threat from someone in your position."

"I'm not the one you should be worried about," Mira replied.

Before the security officer could respond, Selene unleashed her Tide Caller abilities, summoning a vortex of water that caught the woman by surprise. The powerful current slammed her against the trench wall, the impact dislodging her weapon.

Mira immediately followed up, propelling herself forward with her own Tide Caller powers, closing the distance before the woman could recover. The shock baton from her belt was in her hand, its electrical charge dangerous but not immediately lethal in the water.

The security officer fought back with trained precision, her specialized Haven diving suit enhancing her strength and speed. They grappled in the deep water, each seeking advantage, the woman's cold professionalism matched against Mira's desperate fury.

Selene joined the fight, her Tide Caller abilities creating currents that hampered the security officer's movements while aiding Mira's. Together, they gradually gained the upper hand, the woman's advantages of equipment offset by their combined Tide Caller powers.

With a final surge of effort, Mira drove the shock baton into a vulnerable joint in the woman's diving suit. The electrical discharge wasn't enough to kill through the specialized material, but it disrupted the suit's systems, causing it to lock up temporarily.

The security officer was immobilized but still conscious, her cold eyes glaring at Mira through her diving mask. Mira retrieved the woman's fallen weapon, keeping it trained on her as Selene secured her with emergency restraints from their diving gear.

"Now," Mira said, her voice deadly calm despite the adrenaline coursing through her system, "you're going to tell me exactly where my mother is."

The woman's laugh was strained but still defiant. "You think this changes anything? My team is minutes away. You'll never make it to the surface."

"We don't need to," Selene said, activating their emergency beacon. "Our people know where to find us now."

The security officer's expression shifted, the first hint of uncertainty crossing her features. "You're bluffing. Tidefall doesn't have vessels that can reach this depth quickly enough."

"You'd be surprised what we've developed," Mira replied, though in truth, she was counting on Kai having monitored their situation and already dispatched help. The emergency beacon would guide them, but whether assistance would arrive before the rest of the Haven team was an open question.

Another depth charge exploded, this one close enough to send debris raining down around them. The Haven team was getting closer, their pattern of charges systematically eliminating potential hiding places.

"Last chance," Mira said, pressing the weapon against the woman's diving suit where it would penetrate if fired. "Where is my mother?"

Something in Mira's expression must have convinced the security officer that she was deadly serious. The cold amusement faded from her eyes, replaced by a calculating look.

"Eastern Containment," she said finally. "The floating research platform off the continental shelf. That's where the subjects from the black site were relocated after Victor's confession."

"All of them?" Mira pressed. "How many?"

"Twelve surviving subjects," the woman replied. "Your mother among them. But you'll never reach it. The platform is Haven's most secure facility, guarded by the entire Atlantic fleet."

Mira exchanged glances with Selene, both recognizing the name. Eastern Containment was indeed a known Haven facility, one that had been mentioned in the intelligence briefings before the summit. Its existence wasn't secret, but its true purpose apparently was.

"If you're lying," Mira warned, "I'll find you again. And next time, I won't be so merciful."

The security officer's smile returned, though it lacked its former confidence. "By all means, try to rescue mommy dearest. I'll enjoy watching Haven's defenses tear you apart."

A distant rumbling interrupted them, different from the depth charges. This was the sound of engines, powerful ones, approaching rapidly.

"That's not Haven," Selene said, her Tide Caller senses confirming what Mira already suspected. "It's Tidefall. They've received our beacon."

Relief flooded through Mira, though she maintained her guard over the security officer. Kai must have been monitoring their situation more closely than they realized, perhaps even tracking them after they left Tidefall despite their attempts at secrecy.

The approaching vessels appeared at the edge of their vision, specialized submersibles designed for deep-water operations. Not Haven's sleek military craft, but sturdy, practical vessels built from salvaged and repurposed materials, distinctively Tidefall in their construction.

"Looks like your team is going to be outnumbered," Mira observed as more Tidefall vessels appeared, their lights illuminating the trench in a display of force that had the security officer's expression darkening with concern.

The lead vessel maneuvered closer, its external speakers activating to transmit a message through the water.

"Mira, Selene, this is Kai. Prepare for extraction. We've detected Haven vessels in the area and have engaged their perimeter forces. We need to move quickly."

The rescue had arrived just in time. Mira could sense other disturbances in the water now, the sounds of conflict as Tidefall's vessels engaged the Haven security team that had been hunting them.

"What about her?" Selene asked, indicating their prisoner.

Mira considered the security officer, the woman who had taunted her about her parents' deaths, who might have been directly involved in her mother's torture. Every instinct screamed to eliminate this threat permanently.

But the woman was also their only confirmed source of information about Elena Voss's possible survival and location. And Mira needed proof, evidence that could be presented to the Council and to the wider world about Haven's continued atrocities.

"We take her with us," Mira decided. "As evidence. And as a source of information about Eastern Containment."

The security officer's eyes narrowed, but she remained silent as they transferred her to the Tidefall extraction vessel. Kai himself helped them aboard, his expression grim as he took in their injuries and their prisoner.

"You two have a lot of explaining to do," he said, though relief at finding them alive was evident beneath his stern tone. "The Council is not happy about your unauthorized expedition."

"They'll understand when they see what we found," Mira replied, handing him Victor's logbook and the digital evidence she had recovered. "Haven has been conducting experiments on Tide Callers for years. And my mother might still be alive."

Kai's expression shifted from concern to shock. "Elena Voss? Alive?"

"According to our prisoner," Mira confirmed, glancing at the security officer who was now being secured by Tidefall personnel. "Along with other Tide Caller captives, at a facility called Eastern Containment."

The vessel began its ascent as Kai absorbed this information, the implications clearly troubling him. "If this is true, it changes everything. The fragile peace established at the summit..."

"Was built on incomplete truths," Mira finished for him. "Victor confessed to sacrificing New Valencia, but not to the horrors that followed. Not to keeping Tide Callers as research subjects for years afterward."

As they rose toward the surface, leaving the crushing depths of the trench behind, Mira felt the weight of this new knowledge pressing on her with equal force. Her mother, alive. Other Tide Callers, captive. Haven's atrocities continuing even as they pretended to seek reconciliation.

The vessel broke the surface under the cover of darkness, the night sky above scattered with stars that seemed impossibly bright after the darkness of the deep. Mira emerged onto the deck, breathing unfiltered air for the first time in hours, the salt spray on her face a welcome relief.

Other Tidefall vessels surfaced around them, forming a protective perimeter. In the distance, the lights of Haven ships could be seen, maintaining distance but clearly monitoring the situation.

Selene joined her at the railing, her injuries treated but her expression still strained from their ordeal. "What now?"

Mira gazed toward the horizon, in the direction where Eastern Containment would be located, beyond visual range but present in her thoughts with crystal clarity.

"Now we rescue my mother," she said, her voice quiet but filled with iron determination. "And all the others Haven has taken."

The security officer was brought on deck, still restrained but walking under her own power. Her cold eyes met Mira's across the distance, her expression a mixture of defiance and calculation.

"You'll never succeed," she called out, loud enough for others to hear. "Eastern Containment is impregnable. And even if you somehow reached it, what you'd find would break you. Your mother isn't the person you remember. None of them are, after what we've done to them."

Mira approached her slowly, aware of Kai and the others watching with concern. When she stood before the security officer, close enough to see the scars that marked the woman's face in detail, she spoke just loudly enough for those nearby to hear.

"You tortured my mother. Experimented on her. Kept her captive for years while I believed her dead." Mira's voice was controlled, but the rage beneath it was palpable. "You taunted me about my father's death, took pleasure in causing pain."

The security officer's smile returned, cold and cruel. "And I'd do it all again. Your kind are abominations, Tide Callers. Not fully human anymore. The research was necessary to understand and control the threat you represent."

Mira's hand moved before conscious thought, the blade she had palmed from her diving gear pressing against the woman's throat. Not enough to draw blood, but enough to make the threat clear.

"Mira, don't," Kai warned, stepping closer but not interfering directly. "We need her alive, for evidence and information."

The security officer's smile widened, confident in her safety. "Listen to your friend. I'm more valuable to you alive than dead."

For a moment that stretched into eternity, Mira held the blade steady, every fiber of her being crying out for vengeance. The woman who had perhaps killed her father, who had certainly participated in her mother's torture, who had tried to kill both Mira and Selene, stood before her, vulnerable.

Then, with deliberate control, Mira lowered the blade. "You're right," she told Kai, though her eyes remained locked with the security officer's. "We need her alive."

The woman's smile turned triumphant, but Mira wasn't finished.

"I couldn't kill her yet," she added, emphasizing the final word just enough to wipe the smile from the security officer's face. "But when this is over, when my mother and the others are free, when Haven's crimes are exposed to the world... then we'll discuss justice."

As Tidefall personnel led the prisoner away, Mira turned back to the horizon, her resolve hardening into something unbreakable. The blood in the water had been shed, both literally and figuratively. There would be no turning back now, no possibility of the fragile peace established at the summit continuing unchanged.

Haven had continued its atrocities in secret while pretending reconciliation. The truth would now be exposed, whatever the cost. And somewhere out there, beyond the horizon, her mother waited, a ghost made flesh, a victim of Haven's ruthless pursuit of control.

Mira touched the pendant at her throat, feeling the Mediterranean water inside respond to her determination. "I'm coming, Mother," she whispered to the night sea. "Hold on just a little longer."
