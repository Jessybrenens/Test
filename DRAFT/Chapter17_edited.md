# Chapter 17: Blood in the Water

The water pressed against Mira from all sides, the darkness of the flooded laboratory broken only by the faint emergency lights near the sealed door. Through the small viewport, she could see the security officer's retreating form, confident that Mira's fate was sealed.

Mira forced herself to remain calm, conserving oxygen as she assessed her situation. The laboratory was completely submerged now, the water still rising as it sought equilibrium with the ocean outside. Her oxygen hissed steady, but the tank's gauge ticked down too fast. Not enough to wait for rescue.

She needed to find a way out, and quickly.

Focusing her Tide Caller senses, Mira extended her awareness through the water filling the laboratory. The currents twisted against her, disturbed by the rapid flooding, but beneath that turbulence she detected something else: a subtle flow pattern indicating water movement through the structure. Where water could flow out, she might be able to follow.

Swimming carefully through the darkness, Mira traced the current to its source: a maintenance conduit near the floor, partially hidden behind a fallen storage unit. The opening was small, barely wide enough for a person, but it represented her only chance of escape.

Mira wedged herself into the narrow passage, using her arms to pull herself forward through the tight space. The conduit twisted and turned, forcing her to contort her body to navigate its bends. Several times she became stuck, her chest scraped raw, air barely trickling through the mask before she managed to wriggle free.

After what felt like an eternity, the conduit widened slightly, allowing easier movement. The water blurred, edges smudging as her air thinned. The darkness was absolute now, forcing her to rely entirely on touch and her Tide Caller senses to navigate.

Just as her arms grew leaden, each stroke a fight, Mira felt a change in the water pressure. The conduit was sloping upward, leading toward what she hoped was an exit. With renewed determination, she pushed forward, following the gradient until her hands encountered a grate blocking the passage.

The grate was secured with bolts, but years of exposure to saltwater had corroded the metal. Mira braced herself against the sides of the conduit and pushed with all her remaining strength. For a terrifying moment nothing happened, then with a grinding sound that she felt rather than heard, the grate gave way.

Mira burst from the conduit into open water, the sudden freedom almost disorienting after the claustrophobic passage. She oriented herself quickly, recognizing that she had emerged from the side of the Haven facility, away from where the security team would be watching.

Her gasp of relief choked as Haven lights flared closer. The surface was too far to reach before her air ran out. She needed another option.

The submersible. Selene would still be waiting, monitoring for her return. Mira activated her emergency beacon, a risk since it might alert the Haven security team, but necessary to guide Selene to her location.

Swimming with desperate speed, Mira moved away from the facility, putting distance between herself and her pursuers. The water around New Valencia was murky with sediment, providing some cover as she navigated by memory and instinct toward where she hoped Selene would be waiting.

Her chest scraped raw, air barely trickling through the mask. Just as spots began to dance before her eyes, a powerful beam of light cut through the water ahead. The submersible.

Mira's gut sank, a cold void where her mother's laugh used to echo. Behind her, additional lights appeared, cutting through the murk. The Haven security team had detected her escape and was in pursuit, their superior equipment allowing them to move faster through the water.

With the last of her strength, Mira surged toward the submersible, the water blurred, edges smudging as her air thinned. She could see the vessel's airlock opening, Selene's silhouette visible within, reaching out toward her.

Something sharp struck Mira's leg, sending a jolt of pain through her body. A harpoon, fired from one of the pursuing security team members, had grazed her calf, tearing through her diving suit. Blood clouded the water around her, the wound burning as saltwater invaded it.

Selene's hand closed around Mira's arm, pulling her into the submersible's airlock. The outer door sealed just as Mira's consciousness began to fade, the chamber filling with air as the water drained away.

"Mira! Stay with me!" Selene's voice seemed to come from a great distance as she removed Mira's breathing apparatus and checked her vital signs.

Mira gasped, drawing precious air into her starved lungs. The pain in her leg flared as Selene examined the wound, applying pressure to slow the bleeding.

"Haven security," Mira managed between ragged breaths. "They're coming."

"I know," Selene replied grimly, helping Mira into the submersible's main cabin. "We need to move now."

Through the viewport, Mira could see the lights of the pursuing security team growing closer. Selene took the controls, activating the submersible's engines and pulling away from New Valencia's ruins with a burst of speed that pressed Mira back against her seat.

"They're faster than us," Selene observed, her eyes on the sensor display showing multiple vessels in pursuit. "And they're armed."

As if to emphasize her point, something struck the submersible's hull with a metallic clang. Not a direct hit, but close enough to confirm the danger.

"We can't outrun them," Mira acknowledged, wincing as she secured a pressure bandage over her leg wound. "We need to outsmart them."

She studied the navigation display, considering their options. The open ocean offered no cover, making them easy targets. But the ruins of New Valencia itself might provide the advantage they needed.

"There," Mira pointed to a section of the submerged city where tall buildings created a dense underwater maze. "The old financial district. The buildings are close together, passages too narrow for their larger vessels."

Selene nodded, adjusting their course. "It's risky. Lots of debris, collapsed structures."

"Better than being shot out of the water," Mira replied, her voice steadier now as her breathing normalized. "I know these ruins. My father used to take me through the city, showing me the architecture."

The memory brought a fresh wave of anger and grief. The security officer's taunting words echoed in her mind: "I slit their throats myself, your father begged." The casual cruelty, the pride in her voice as she described murdering Mira's parents, ignited a rage that burned through the pain and exhaustion.

Selene guided the submersible into the labyrinth of submerged buildings, navigating with remarkable skill through narrow gaps and around dangerous debris. The pursuing vessels followed, but their larger size and less maneuverable design forced them to slow down, giving Mira and Selene a slight advantage.

"What happened in there?" Selene asked as they momentarily ducked into the hollow shell of what had once been a bank, hiding from the searchlights of their pursuers. "What did you find?"

Mira's voice cracked, caught between a shout and a whisper. "Evidence. Proof that Haven didn't just destroy New Valencia, they extracted specific people first. Including my mother."

Selene's pupils flared, darting to the cave's mouth. "Your mother survived the destruction?"

"Only to suffer something worse," Mira replied, her will sharpened, a blade honed by the trench's weight. "They kept her as a research subject, experimenting on her Tide Caller abilities. For years."

She flipped through the logbook, showing Selene the damning entries. "Victor knew. He ordered it all, including their eventual elimination when they were no longer useful."

"But at the summit, he seemed genuinely remorseful," Selene said, confusion evident in her voice. "His confession, his cooperation..."

"A partial truth at best," Mira cut in. "He confessed to sacrificing New Valencia, yes. But not to the experiments that followed, not to keeping my mother alive as a test subject, not to her execution when she was no longer useful."

The submersible's proximity alarm sounded, warning of an approaching vessel. Selene quickly adjusted their position, moving deeper into the ruins to evade detection.

"There's more," Mira continued once they were temporarily safe. "The facility was evacuated just after the summit concluded. Victor's confession triggered a cleanup operation, eliminating evidence and any remaining subjects."

"Subjects?" Selene echoed, horror dawning in her expression. "There were others?"

"Other Tide Callers," Mira confirmed grimly. "I don't know how many or if any survived. But the woman I encountered, the security officer, she spoke as if she had personally been involved in both my parents' deaths."

The memory of the woman's cold smile, her casual cruelty, sent a fresh surge of rage through Mira. "She's still there, still hunting us. I need to go back, to capture her, make her tell me everything she knows."

"That's suicide," Selene objected, checking the sensors again. "There's an entire Haven security team up there, probably calling for reinforcements. We need to get this evidence back to Tidefall, let the Council decide how to proceed."

Mira knew Selene was right, but the thought of letting her parents' killer escape was almost unbearable. The woman's words had been deliberately provocative, designed to cause pain, but they also suggested she possessed knowledge that Mira desperately needed.

"Your mother didn't die," the woman had taunted. Was that merely cruelty, or could there be truth in it? Could Elena Voss somehow still be alive, perhaps held in another facility?

Before Mira could respond, a powerful impact rocked the submersible, sending them both lurching against their restraints. Warning lights flashed across the control panel.

"Direct hit," Selene reported, her fingers flying over the controls. "Hull integrity compromised in the aft section. We're taking on water."

Another impact followed, more devastating than the first. The submersible's main power failed, emergency systems activating with a dull red glow that bathed the cabin in blood-like light.

"We're losing propulsion," Selene announced, fighting with the now-unresponsive controls. "And the ballast systems are failing. We're going to sink."

Mira quickly assessed their situation. The submersible was designed with emergency protocols for just such a scenario, but those systems assumed a controlled descent to the seafloor, not a combat situation with hostile forces in pursuit.

"Can we reach the surface?" she asked, already knowing the answer.

Selene shook her head. "Not with the damage we've sustained. And they're above us now anyway." She pointed to the sensor display, which showed Haven vessels positioned to cut off any escape toward the surface.

"Then we go deeper," Mira decided. "Use the current emergency ballast release. We'll drop to the seafloor, fast enough that they might lose track of us in the debris cloud."

It was a desperate plan, but their only option. Selene activated the emergency release, and the submersible plummeted toward the ocean floor, the rapid descent pressing them into their seats with uncomfortable force.

The impact when they hit bottom was jarring despite the automated cushioning systems. Warning indicators showed multiple system failures, and water was now visibly seeping into the cabin from damaged seals.

"We need to seal that breach," Mira said, unbuckling from her seat and moving toward the source of the leak. "Help me with the emergency patch kit."

Together, they applied sealant to the damaged section, temporarily slowing the water ingress. But both knew it was only a stopgap measure; the submersible was too badly damaged for a permanent repair.

"Communications?" Mira asked, returning to her seat.

Selene shook her head. "Offline. And even if they weren't, we're too deep for standard frequencies to penetrate to the surface."

"What about the emergency beacon?"

"It's functional, but using it would reveal our position to the Haven vessels as well as any potential rescuers."

Mira considered their options. The submersible's life support systems were still functioning, providing breathable air and maintaining temperature, but with the hull breach, those systems would eventually fail. They needed to either repair the vessel enough to return to the surface or find another way out.

"What's our exact position?" she asked, studying the navigation display.

Selene brought up the map. "We're on the edge of New Valencia's old harbor district. There's a deep trench about half a kilometer east that leads toward open water."

"And the Haven vessels?"

"Still searching the financial district where we lost them. But they'll expand their search pattern soon."

Mira nodded, a plan forming. "We need to abandon the submersible."

Selene stared at her in disbelief. "And do what? Swim? At this depth, with Haven hunting us?"

"Not swim all the way back," Mira clarified. "Just to the trench. There's an old maintenance tunnel that runs beneath the harbor, part of New Valencia's original infrastructure. My father showed it to me once, explained how it was designed as an emergency evacuation route in case of flooding."

"Ironic," Selene muttered.

"The tunnel should still be intact," Mira continued. "It leads to a series of airlocks that eventually connect to what used to be the coastal highway. If we can reach it, we can follow it several kilometers before we need to surface, well away from Haven's search area."

"That's assuming the tunnel hasn't collapsed in all these years underwater," Selene pointed out.

"It's reinforced with the same materials Haven uses for their deep-sea installations," Mira replied. "Designed to withstand pressure and corrosion. It's our best chance."

Selene considered this, then nodded reluctantly. "What about the logbook? The evidence?"

Mira patted her waterproof pouch. "Secure. And I'll digitally scan the key pages with my comm unit before we leave, transmit them to Kai's secure channel. Even if we don't make it back, the evidence will."

They worked quickly, gathering essential supplies and preparing their diving gear. The submersible's emergency systems included rebreathers that would extend their oxygen supply beyond standard tanks, crucial for the long underwater journey ahead.

As Selene prepared the emergency beacon to activate after their departure, a low growl rolled through the water, sharper than the charges.

"Depth charges," Selene whispered, her face paling. "They're trying to force us to surface or flush us out of hiding."

Another explosion followed, closer this time, the pressure wave rocking the damaged submersible. Small objects fell from shelves, and the water leak increased noticeably.

"We need to move now," Mira urged, securing her rebreather and checking Selene's equipment. "Set the beacon to activate in thirty minutes. That should give us enough time to reach the tunnel entrance."

Selene nodded, making the final adjustments to the beacon. "Ready."

They moved to the airlock, the small chamber barely large enough for both of them with their equipment. As the inner door sealed and water began to fill the chamber, Mira reached out and squeezed Selene's hand.

"Stay close to me," she instructed. "The visibility will be poor, and the currents near the trench can be treacherous."

When the chamber was fully flooded, they opened the outer door and swam into the dark waters of New Valencia's ruins. Mira took the lead, using her Tide Caller senses to navigate through the murky depths. Above them, faint flashes of light indicated the Haven vessels continuing their search, and the periodic rumble of depth charges sent pressure waves through the water.

They swam close to the seafloor, using the ruined buildings for cover as they made their way toward the harbor trench. The journey was slow and tense, each movement carefully calculated to avoid stirring up sediment that might reveal their position.

As they approached the edge of the trench, Mira paused, signaling Selene to wait. Ahead, a Haven search vessel was descending into the trench, its powerful lights sweeping methodically across the underwater terrain.

They pressed themselves against the side of a collapsed building, waiting as the vessel passed overhead. Once it had moved a safe distance away, they continued toward the trench, swimming more quickly now as their oxygen supplies steadily depleted.

The trench was deeper than Mira remembered, its walls steep and covered in marine growth. They descended carefully, Mira scanning the eastern wall for the tunnel entrance. After several tense minutes, she spotted it: a circular opening partially obscured by sediment and coral growth, but unmistakably artificial in its perfect symmetry.

Mira pointed it out to Selene, who nodded in understanding. They swam toward the entrance, Mira leading the way into the dark tunnel. Once inside, she activated a small light attached to her diving gear, revealing a long, straight passage extending into the darkness.

The tunnel was in better condition than Mira had dared hope, its reinforced walls still intact despite years underwater. They swam steadily through it, the enclosed space a stark contrast to the open waters they had left behind.

After several hundred meters, the tunnel began to slope upward, eventually leading to the first of the airlocks Mira had mentioned. The mechanism was old but functional, designed to operate even after long periods of disuse.

Together, they cycled through the airlock, emerging into a section of tunnel that was partially flooded but contained an air pocket at the top. They removed their breathing apparatus, conserving oxygen as they waded through knee-deep water.

"How much further?" Selene asked, her voice echoing in the confined space.

"Two more airlocks, then we reach the highway tunnel," Mira replied. "From there, it's about five kilometers to where we can safely surface."

They continued through the tunnel, passing through the remaining airlocks until they reached the larger highway tunnel. Here, the flooding was minimal, allowing them to walk rather than swim. Their progress was faster now, though both were exhausted from the long underwater journey.

As they neared the point where Mira believed they could safely surface, a distant sound echoed through the tunnel behind them. Voices, and the splash of movement through water.

"They've found the tunnel," Selene whispered, her face tight with fear.

"We're almost there," Mira encouraged, increasing her pace despite her exhaustion. "Just a little further."

The tunnel began to slope upward more steeply, and ahead they could see where it emerged above the waterline, leading to what had once been a coastal access road. But the sounds behind them were growing louder, the pursuit closing the gap.

"Go," Mira urged Selene, handing her the waterproof pouch containing Victor's logbook. "Get to the surface, find a way back to Tidefall. I'll hold them off."

"No," Selene refused, pushing the pouch back toward Mira. "We both go, or neither of us does."

Before Mira could argue further, a light appeared behind them, illuminating the tunnel. A voice called out, the words indistinct but the threat clear.

With no other choice, they ran toward the tunnel exit, their footsteps splashing through the shallow water. The incline grew steeper, the water level dropping until they were on dry ground, the exit just ahead.

A shot rang out, the projectile striking the tunnel wall near Mira's head. They ducked lower, running in a crouch as more shots followed.

Finally, they reached the exit, emerging onto a rocky shoreline under the night sky. The coastal highway was long gone, eroded away by rising seas, but a narrow strip of land remained, leading toward distant lights that might indicate a settlement.

"There," Selene pointed toward the lights. "If we can reach it, we might find help."

They set off along the shoreline, staying close to the water where their Tide Caller abilities would give them an advantage if the pursuit continued. Behind them, shouts indicated that their pursuers had reached the tunnel exit.

More shots rang out, but they were already moving among the rocks, using the terrain for cover as they made their way toward the distant settlement. The chase continued through the night, a desperate race between exhausted fugitives and determined hunters.

After what seemed like hours, the lights of the settlement grew closer. It was smaller than it had appeared from a distance, just a handful of structures built on stilts above the water, likely a fishing outpost rather than a proper settlement.

"We need a boat," Mira said, scanning the small docks where several vessels were moored. "Something fast."

They approached cautiously, alert for any sign of Haven presence. The settlement appeared quiet, its inhabitants likely asleep at this late hour. They made their way to the docks, examining the available vessels.

"This one," Selene indicated a sleek skiff with an outboard motor. "It looks well-maintained."

Mira nodded, helping Selene untie the mooring lines. "I'll leave payment and a note explaining the emergency. We're not thieves."

As they prepared to depart, a light appeared on the shore behind them. Their pursuers had reached the settlement. There was no more time for niceties; they needed to leave immediately.

Mira started the motor, guiding the skiff away from the dock as shots rang out behind them. Selene used her Tide Caller abilities to create a wave that pushed them faster, putting distance between them and the shore.

Soon they were speeding across the open water, the settlement receding into the distance. Mira set a course for Tidefall, pushing the small vessel to its limits. They had escaped, for now, and carried with them evidence that could change everything.

As dawn broke over the horizon, Selene broke the silence. "What you found in that facility... about your mother. Do you think there's any chance she could still be alive?"

The question had been haunting Mira since her encounter with the security officer. The woman's taunt, "Your mother didn't die. She's rotting in Haven's black site, a lab rat now," could have been merely psychological torture. But what if it contained a kernel of truth?

"The records I found indicated she was terminated five years ago," Mira said slowly. "But Haven has lied about everything else. Why not this too?"

Selene nodded, understanding the implications. "If she is alive, she'd be in another facility, one even more secure than what we found at New Valencia."

"The security officer mentioned a black site," Mira recalled. "No specific location, but the way she spoke suggested it was operational, current."

"The Council will need to know everything," Selene said. "This goes beyond just New Valencia now. If Haven is still conducting experiments on Tide Callers, holding them against their will..."

"It's an act of war," Mira finished grimly. "One they've been committing in secret for years."

They fell silent again, each lost in thought as the skiff sped toward Tidefall. The evidence they carried would shatter the fragile peace established at the summit, potentially triggering open conflict between Haven and the independent settlements. But the truth could no longer remain hidden, not after what Mira had discovered.

As the familiar silhouette of Tidefall appeared on the horizon, Mira's resolve hardened. Whether her mother was alive or not, justice would be served. Haven would answer for its crimes, and the truth about New Valencia would finally be known to all.

The skiff cut through the waves, carrying them home with their dangerous cargo of truth. Behind them, somewhere in Haven's secret network of facilities, other Tide Callers might still be suffering as her mother had. Mira would find them, free them, and bring down those responsible, whatever the cost.

The waters still stirred, remembering big ships, laden with heavy gear, maybe a month back.
