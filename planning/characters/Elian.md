# Elian Reeves - Love Interest / Deuteragonist

## Core Identity

### Background
Born into the powerful Reeves dynasty, Elian is the only son of Victor Reeves, CEO of Oceanic Solutions—one of the largest corporations that survived and thrived after the Great Flood. Raised in Celestia Haven, the most prestigious of the floating cities, Elian grew up with every privilege imaginable. His mother, Sophia Reeves, died when he was 14, officially from a rare illness, though rumors persist about the true circumstances of her death.

Unlike his ruthless father, Elian developed an interest in environmental restoration and historical preservation. He was educated at the exclusive Haven Academy, then sent to study engineering and corporate management at what remained of prestigious universities. During his studies, he discovered disturbing information about his father's company's role in suppressing climate research before the flood. This discovery led him to secretly fund restoration projects and historical archives while maintaining the facade of a carefree corporate heir.
