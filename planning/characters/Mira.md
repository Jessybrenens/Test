# Mira Voss - Protagonist

## Core Identity

### Background
Born in the coastal city of New Valencia (now submerged), Mira Voss was raised in a middle-class family with strong academic ties. Her mother was a marine biologist and her father an environmental engineer, both employed by the university that would later become Tidefall. Mira was 12 years old when the Deluge phase of flooding began, forcing her family to evacuate their home. During the chaotic evacuation, her parents were separated from her when the emergency vessel they were on capsized in a storm. Mira survived by manifesting her water manipulation abilities for the first time, unconsciously creating a bubble of calm water around herself.

She was rescued and eventually taken in by Selene Marinos, a former colleague of her parents who recognized Mira's unique abilities. Under Selene's guidance, Mira received education in oceanography and environmental science, while secretly developing her Tide Caller abilities.
