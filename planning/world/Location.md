# Tidefall: Central Location

## Original Purpose: Coastal University and Research Center

### History
Before the Great Flood, Tidefall was one of the world's premier oceanographic research institutions, situated on a picturesque coastal bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Founded in 2035 as a joint venture between several technology corporations and academic institutions, it was designed to be the cutting edge of marine science and climate research.

### Physical Description (Pre-Flood)
- A sprawling campus of sleek, modern buildings with extensive glass facades
- Six major research buildings arranged in a hexagonal pattern
- Central courtyard with an iconic spiral sculpture representing ocean currents
- Underground research facilities extending into the coastal bedrock
- Private harbor with research vessels and submersibles
- Sustainable design with solar panels, wind turbines, and living roofs
- Population of approximately 5,000 researchers, students, and support staff

### Research Focus
Tidefall specialized in several areas that would later prove ironically prophetic:
- Climate change mitigation technologies
- Rising sea level adaptation strategies
- Marine ecosystem preservation
- Experimental water purification systems
- Ocean-based renewable energy
- Underwater habitation prototypes

### The Transformation
As sea levels rose during the Great Flood, Tidefall's position on a coastal bluff initially protected it from the first phase of flooding. The institution became a center for climate crisis response, with its researchers working frantically to develop solutions.

During the Acceleration phase (2080-2100), the university implemented its own experimental technologies to stay above water:
- Flotation systems were attached to building foundations
- Breakwaters were constructed from nanomaterial composites
- The campus was gradually transformed into a partially floating structure
- Many buildings were connected with elevated walkways and bridges

By the time of the Deluge (2100-2120), Tidefall had become one of the few academic institutions to survive intact, though its mission had shifted entirely to survival technology. As social structures collapsed and reformed, corporate interests seized control of the facility, eventually transforming it into its current state.

## Current State: Floating Marketplace and Neutral Zone

### Physical Description (2150)
- A floating complex of interconnected structures at different elevations
- The original hexagonal layout is still visible from above
- Buildings have been modified with multiple additional levels, some extending below the waterline
- The central courtyard has become a marketplace plaza with the original spiral sculpture now serving as a landmark and meeting point
- Connecting bridges, walkways, and docks create a complex three-dimensional layout
- Underwater levels house storage, some residences, and specialized businesses
- Population fluctuates between 15,000-20,000 permanent residents, with thousands more visiting for trade

### Social Function
Tidefall serves several crucial functions in the post-flood world:

#### 1. Neutral Trading Ground
- One of the few places where Haven elites, Tide Dwellers, and the Drowned can interact with minimal restrictions
- Enforced neutrality maintained by a coalition of merchant guilds
- Complex system of customs and protocols govern interactions between social classes

#### 2. Knowledge Repository
- Houses one of the largest surviving libraries of pre-flood information
- Access to information is tiered based on status and payment
- Some original Tidefall researchers and their descendants maintain academic traditions
- Underground data centers preserve digital archives from before the collapse

#### 3. Technological Crossroads
- Black and gray markets for technology flourish
- Haven technology occasionally filters down through here to wider population
- Salvage technology innovations spread upward to Havens
- Repair and modification services for all types of technology

#### 4. Cultural Melting Pot
- Diverse religious practices and cultural traditions coexist
- Entertainment venues showcase art forms from all social strata
- Culinary traditions from around the flooded world are preserved and evolve
- Temporary accommodations allow for cultural exchanges and celebrations

### Governance
Tidefall operates under a complex governance system:

- The Merchant Council: Representatives from major trading interests who manage commerce and basic infrastructure
- The Tide Wardens: Security force that maintains neutrality and enforces the peace
- The Knowledge Trust: Descendants of original faculty who manage information resources
- The Deep Assembly: Representatives from underwater residents and businesses
- Haven Observers: Corporate representatives who maintain Haven interests without direct control

### Strategic Importance
Tidefall's unique position as a neutral zone makes it strategically valuable to all factions:

- For Havens: A place to acquire unique resources and monitor the lower classes
- For Tide Dwellers: The primary marketplace for their specialized services and goods
- For the Drowned: A rare opportunity to access technology, medicine, and information
- For Tide Callers: A secret meeting place where they can exchange information and techniques

### Hidden Aspects
Beneath the surface of daily commerce, Tidefall harbors secrets:

- Original research laboratories deep underwater still contain experimental technology
- A network of hidden passages and rooms used by various factions
- Secret meetings between Tide Callers occur in specially shielded chambers
- Some original Tidefall researchers work covertly to reverse environmental damage
- Rumors persist of a massive underwater data center containing the "Solution" - technology that could potentially reverse the flooding
