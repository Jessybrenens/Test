# World of Tides of Vengeance

## The Flooded Earth (2150)

### Global Geography
The world of 2150 bears little resemblance to the coastlines of the 21st century. Rising sea levels have transformed the planet's geography, with water covering approximately 85% of Earth's surface (compared to 71% in 2000). Major coastal cities worldwide have either been abandoned, transformed into underwater ruins, or adapted into partially submerged metropolises.

The remaining landmass consists primarily of:
- Former continental highlands (Appalachian highlands, Rocky Mountains, Alps, Himalayas, etc.)
- Artificial islands and floating structures
- Scattered archipelagos formed from former mountain ranges

### Climate Patterns
Global warming has created more extreme and unpredictable weather patterns:
- Hypercanes (super hurricanes) form regularly in tropical regions
- Monsoon seasons have intensified and expanded geographically
- Polar regions experience dramatic seasonal fluctuations
- Ocean currents have shifted, creating new climate zones

### Social Structure
Humanity has reorganized into three distinct societal tiers:

#### 1. The Haven Elites
- Reside in luxurious floating cities called "Havens"
- Control remaining resources and advanced technology
- Dominated by corporate dynasties that survived (and often profited from) the climate catastrophe
- Maintain private security forces and exclusive access to pre-flood technology
- Population: Approximately 2% of surviving humanity

#### 2. The Tide Dwellers
- Middle class that lives in mid-tier floating communities or repurposed structures
- Work specialized jobs that service Haven needs (technicians, traders, entertainers, etc.)
- Have limited access to technology and moderate resources
- Often serve as intermediaries between Havens and Drowned communities
- Population: Approximately 30% of surviving humanity

#### 3. The Drowned
- Displaced masses living in makeshift communities built on skyscraper remnants, mountain slopes, and salvaged vessels
- Survive through fishing, salvage, and bartering
- Limited access to technology, medicine, or education
- Often develop adaptations to aquatic life (both cultural and, in some cases, physiological)
- Population: Approximately 68% of surviving humanity

### Technology
Technology development has bifurcated between:

#### Haven Technology
- Advanced clean energy (fusion, efficient solar, tidal)
- Genetic engineering and advanced medicine
- Atmospheric processors and weather modification
- Luxury automation and AI systems
- Drone and robotic workforce

#### Salvage Technology
- Repurposed pre-flood technology
- Ingenious water filtration and collection systems
- Sustainable aquaculture and vertical farming
- Salvaged and modified transportation (boats, submersibles)
- Hand-crafted tools and weapons from reclaimed materials

### The Great Flood
The catastrophic sea level rise occurred in three major phases:

#### Phase 1: The Slow Rise (2025-2080)
- Gradual sea level rise of approximately 2 meters
- Coastal cities implemented seawalls and adaptation measures
- Millions displaced but organized relocation efforts maintained stability
- Technology focused on mitigation and adaptation

#### Phase 2: The Acceleration (2080-2100)
- Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets reached tipping points
- Sea levels rose 10 additional meters in just 20 years
- Major coastal cities abandoned or transformed
- Global economic systems collapsed and reformed around remaining resources
- Mass migration and conflict over remaining habitable land

#### Phase 3: The Deluge (2100-2120)
- East Antarctic ice sheet partial collapse
- Additional 15-meter sea level rise
- Remaining coastal infrastructure overwhelmed
- Formation of current social hierarchy as corporations seized control of resources
- Development of floating Haven cities for the wealthy and powerful

### Magical Elements
Following the Great Flood, a small percentage of humans began exhibiting unusual abilities related to water manipulation. These individuals, known as "Tide Callers," can:

- Sense water currents and pressure changes
- Manipulate water movement on small to moderate scales
- Communicate over distances through water vibrations
- Some can even breathe underwater for extended periods

Scientific theories about these abilities include:
- Exposure to unknown compounds released from melting ice sheets
- Genetic adaptations triggered by environmental pressure
- Interaction with nanomaterials from pre-flood technology
- Natural selection favoring water-adapted traits

The Haven elites officially deny the existence of these abilities, dismissing them as tricks or technology, while secretly researching and sometimes hunting those who possess them.

### Flora and Fauna
Marine ecosystems have dramatically transformed:

- Massive algae blooms create "dead zones" in some regions
- New coral species have evolved to thrive in warmer, more acidic waters
- Jellyfish populations have exploded
- Genetically modified fish species (both escaped from pre-flood farms and deliberately engineered) dominate many food chains
- Some terrestrial animals have adapted to semi-aquatic lifestyles
- Floating gardens and farms use specialized plant varieties engineered to grow in saltwater environments

### Religion and Belief Systems
New religious and philosophical movements have emerged:

- The Tidal Faith: Worships the ocean as a cleansing force that punished humanity's hubris
- The Restorationists: Believe in a divine mandate to restore Earth to pre-flood conditions
- The Evolutionists: See the flood as the next step in human evolution toward an aquatic future
- Corporate Prosperity Doctrine: Teaches that the elites were "chosen" to survive and lead
- The Memory Keepers: Dedicated to preserving pre-flood knowledge and culture
