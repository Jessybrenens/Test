- New technologies developed that enhance rather than disrupt natural processes

## Key Revelations and Twists

1. Some station staff are secretly Tide Callers working with Sophia's network
2. The quantum drive contains evidence that Tide Callers were the result of corporate experimentation, not natural mutation
3. Victor's obsession with Project Watershed stems from guilt over Sophia's "death" and desire to prove his approach was right
4. The modulation technology is partly based on studying Tide Caller abilities, creating a dark irony
5. Dr. Nakamura is revealed to have been Sophia's student before the Deluge, explaining her willingness to help

## Climactic Sequence
The story builds toward a triple climax:
1. **Personal**: Confrontation between Victor, Sophia, Elian and Mira where all truths are revealed
2. **Technical**: Crisis as the modulation station begins to fail catastrophically
3. **Social**: Broadcast of evidence leading to Haven-wide recognition of corporate climate crimes

The resolution intertwines these threads, with the technical crisis forcing personal choices that enable social transformation.
