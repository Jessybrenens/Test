# Chapter 2: The Heir

Elian Reeves stood at the floor-to-ceiling window of his father's office, watching the sunset paint Celestia Haven in shades of gold and crimson. From this height—the 137th floor of Oceanic Solutions' headquarters—the floating city resembled an elaborate jewel set upon the endless blue. Beautiful, pristine, and utterly disconnected from the world below.

"You're not listening to me, son."

Elian turned from the view to face his father. Victor Reeves sat behind a desk of salvaged redwood, its polished surface reflecting the room's ambient lighting. At sixty-three, Victor remained imposing—silver hair precisely cut, posture military-straight, eyes sharp as the day he'd seized control of his first failing company during the Acceleration phase.

"I heard every word, Father," Elian replied, keeping his voice neutral. "The southern agricultural platform needs expansion. The Tide Dweller labor dispute requires resolution. The Haven Council seeks our support for increased security measures." He paused. "Did I miss anything?"

Victor's expression remained impassive, but Elian caught the slight narrowing of his eyes—the only tell his father ever displayed when annoyed.

"You heard. But you weren't listening." Victor tapped his finger against a holographic report hovering above his desk. "These security measures aren't just bureaucratic overreach. The incidents of Tide Caller infiltration increased twenty-seven percent last quarter. They're becoming bolder, more organized."

Elian maintained his composed expression with practiced ease. "Perhaps because Haven security keeps abducting them for 'research purposes'?"

"Study," Victor corrected. "Not abduction. These genetic anomalies could provide valuable insights. Adaptations we might harness."

"They're people, Father. Not specimens."

Victor waved his hand dismissively. "People with abilities that give them unfair advantages in a water-dominated world. Abilities they hide while infiltrating our society." He leaned forward. "Your sympathy for the lower tiers is admirable in theory, Elian, but misplaced in practice. Our position requires pragmatism."

The familiar argument. Elian knew better than to pursue it directly. Instead, he changed tactics.

"Speaking of pragmatism, I've been reviewing the Watershed Project files you granted me access to."

Interest flickered across Victor's face. "And?"

"The theoretical framework is sound, but the power requirements are prohibitive. We'd need to divert resources from three Haven sectors for initial testing alone."

"A temporary inconvenience for a permanent solution," Victor said. "If we could control water levels globally—"

"We'd be playing god," Elian finished. "Again."

The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees. Victor's expression hardened.

"The first time wasn't playing god. It was survival. The corporations that survived the Deluge did so because they made difficult decisions while governments debated and delayed." Victor stood, walking to join Elian at the window. "Look at what we built from the ruins, son. Celestia Haven houses fifty thousand people in comfort and security. Our agricultural platforms feed millions. Our desalination technology provides clean water to even the Drowned communities."

Elian had heard this speech countless times. The corporate savior narrative that Haven children learned instead of history. He knew better than to challenge it directly—not yet, not without more evidence.

"I understand the project's potential benefits," Elian said carefully. "I'm merely suggesting we consider less invasive approaches first. The restoration initiatives I've proposed—"

"Band-aids," Victor interrupted. "Your restoration projects might green a few rooftops or purify a few square kilometers of ocean, but they don't address the fundamental problem." He gestured toward the horizon, where the sun was slipping beneath the endless water. "Seventy-five meters of sea level rise. Billions displaced. Entire nations erased. The world needs more than incremental improvements, Elian. It needs transformation."

The irony wasn't lost on Elian. The same corporations that had ignored climate warnings, suppressed research, and prioritized quarterly profits over planetary health now positioned themselves as humanity's only hope. His father genuinely believed in his vision—that was what made Victor so dangerous.

"I'll review the power requirement calculations again," Elian conceded. "Perhaps there's an efficiency we've overlooked."

Victor's expression softened marginally. He placed a hand on Elian's shoulder—a rare gesture of physical affection.

"You have your mother's heart, Elian. She always worried about the human cost too." Something flickered behind Victor's eyes—an emotion quickly suppressed. "But remember what she used to say: 'Compassion without action is just sentiment.'"

The mention of his mother sent a familiar ache through Elian's chest. Sophia Reeves had died when he was fourteen—a "rare autoimmune disorder" according to official records. Nineteen years later, her absence remained a wound that never fully healed.

"I remember," Elian said quietly. What Victor conveniently omitted was the rest of Sophia's saying: "And action without compassion is just cruelty."

Victor's comm unit chimed, breaking the moment. He checked the notification and frowned.

"The Haven Council meeting has been moved up. We'll continue this discussion tomorrow." He straightened his already immaculate jacket. "I expect you at the Watershed Project review at 0900. Dr. Nakamura is presenting the latest simulation results."

Elian nodded. "I'll be there."

After Victor left, Elian remained by the window, watching the lights of Celestia Haven illuminate against the darkening sky. From this height, you couldn't see the barriers that separated the Haven elite from the Tide Dweller service class. You couldn't see the security drones that patrolled the perimeter, ensuring no unauthorized vessels approached. You certainly couldn't see the Drowned communities that clustered around the floating city's moorings, surviving on scraps from above.

His father saw a triumph of human ingenuity and corporate leadership. Elian saw a monument to inequality and selective memory.

He waited fifteen minutes to ensure Victor was well on his way to the Council meeting before accessing his father's private terminal. As the CEO's son and heir apparent, Elian had extensive access privileges—though not unlimited. What he was about to do would be considered corporate espionage at best, treason at worst.

"James," he spoke into his personal comm unit. "Is the path clear?"

"Yes, sir," his assistant replied promptly. "Your father's transport left the dock three minutes ago. Security cameras on the executive floor are running the loop program for the next twenty minutes—standard privacy protocol during your father's absence."

"Thank you. Please ensure I'm not disturbed."

"Of course, sir. Your 'deep work' status has been activated in the building system."

Elian smiled slightly. James had been with him for five years—initially assigned by Victor to report on his activities, a fact both men acknowledged openly now. Over time, James had seen enough to make his own decisions about where his true loyalties should lie.

Elian placed his palm on the terminal's biometric scanner. The system recognized him, but a secondary authentication screen appeared—one requesting a password for the restricted archives. He entered the code he'd obtained by carefully observing his father's keystrokes during a moment of distraction last week.

The screen flashed green. Access granted.

Elian navigated quickly to the historical archives—specifically, the pre-flood corporate records that had been digitized and preserved. Most Haven residents believed these records had been lost during the Deluge. In reality, the corporations had maintained meticulous backups of anything that might prove useful or incriminating.

He searched for files related to the climate research suppression of the 2060s—the decade when the Acceleration phase might still have been prevented. Most files were heavily redacted or encrypted beyond his current capabilities. But occasionally, he found fragments that slipped through the censors.

A memo from 2063 caught his attention:

```
FROM: V. Reeves
TO: Executive Committee
SUBJECT: Sofia Institute Findings

The SI projections must not reach regulatory agencies. Containment protocol Alpha is authorized. Dr. Voss and her team require special handling. Plausible deniability essential.

Recommendation: Acquisition of SI through shell corporation followed by immediate dissolution. Research materials to be secured in deep storage facility 9.

This communication will self-delete in 24 hours.
```

Elian stared at the screen, his heart pounding. Dr. Voss. The name meant nothing to him, but the implications were clear. His father had personally ordered the suppression of climate research—research that might have prevented or mitigated the catastrophe that followed.

And "special handling" was corporate euphemism for something far darker than simple termination of employment.

He quickly copied the file to his secure drive before continuing his search. Another document appeared—a fragment of a larger report:

```
...genetic adaptations observed in approximately 0.03% of test subjects exposed to compound SX-7 during trials. Adaptations include enhanced pressure resistance, oxygen efficiency, and limited hydrokinetic capabilities. Subjects display distinctive dermal markings resembling scales...
```

The document was dated 2097—during the height of the Deluge. Elian frowned. This aligned with the emergence of the first Tide Callers, but contradicted the official narrative that their abilities were spontaneous mutations caused by environmental stress.

If Tide Callers were the result of corporate experimentation...

A soft chime interrupted his thoughts—James's warning that his window was closing. Elian quickly copied the fragment and closed the terminal, erasing all traces of his search.

He straightened his jacket and composed his features into the mask of the dutiful corporate heir—a mask he'd perfected over years of necessity. By the time he left the office, no observer would have detected anything amiss in his demeanor.

But inside, his mind raced with implications and connections. The climate research suppression. His mother's mysterious illness. The Tide Caller origins. The Watershed Project. Pieces of a puzzle he'd been assembling for years, each new fragment revealing a picture more disturbing than he'd imagined.

His private transport waited at the executive dock. As he settled into the plush interior, he activated his secure communication device—one unknown to Haven security or his father's surveillance.

"Dr. Chen," he said when the connection established. "I've found something you should see. Can you meet tonight?"

"The usual place?" The elderly archivist's voice crackled through the encrypted channel.

"Yes. And Dr. Chen? Be careful. I think we're getting close to something they'll kill to protect."

He ended the transmission and gazed out at Celestia Haven as his transport navigated between gleaming towers. The beautiful floating city, built on secrets as much as on advanced engineering. His home. His inheritance. His burden.

Elian Reeves, heir to Oceanic Solutions, was committing treason against everything his father had built. And he was just getting started.
