# Chapter 3: The Discovery

The marketplace at Tidefall never truly slept. Even in the pre-dawn hours, when most of the floating settlement's lights dimmed to conserve power, the trading hub maintained a persistent hum of activity. Salvagers returned from night expeditions. Food vendors prepared for the morning rush. Tide Dweller maintenance crews repaired the countless systems that kept the repurposed structures afloat.

Mira navigated through this quieter version of the marketplace with practiced ease. Her collection bag, now disguised as ordinary salvage, hung heavily from her shoulder. The quantum drive inside represented her most valuable find in months—possibly years, depending on its contents.

She approached a nondescript stall wedged between a kelp noodle vendor and a reclamation specialist. Despite its unremarkable appearance, Kai's trading post was one of Tidefall's most valuable information exchanges. The man himself sat on a stool behind his counter, fingers dancing across three different data tablets simultaneously. He didn't look up as Mira approached.

"You're late," he said, still focused on his screens. "Drone patrol?"

"Off-schedule sweep," Mira confirmed, setting her bag on the counter. "Someone changed the patterns without updating the public logs."

This caught Kai's attention. He looked up, dark eyes narrowing beneath a shock of salt-stiffened hair. At forty-something, Kai's face carried the weathered look of someone who'd survived the worst of the Deluge as a child. Like many Tide Dwellers, his origins were a carefully guarded secret.

"Third time this month," he said, lowering his voice. "Haven security's getting creative. Or desperate."

Mira nodded toward her bag. "Let's talk inside."

Kai glanced around the marketplace before tapping a sequence on his counter. A section of the floor behind his stall slid open, revealing a narrow staircase descending below the waterline. He gestured for Mira to go first.

The room below was a stark contrast to the weathered stall above. Clean, well-lit, and packed with technology that would make Haven engineers envious. Kai's true business—information brokerage and authentication of salvaged tech—required equipment far beyond what most Tide Dwellers could access.

Mira placed her bag on the examination table and carefully extracted the quantum drive. Kai let out a low whistle.

"Oceanic Solutions QS-7 model. Pre-flood. Where did you find this beauty?"

"Old financial district. Data storage company headquarters." Mira watched as Kai gently placed the drive in a diagnostic cradle. "Can you access it?"

"Maybe." Kai's fingers flew across his terminal. "These units were designed to withstand extreme conditions. Self-contained power cells, triple-redundant storage matrices. If the seals held..." He trailed off, focused on his work.

Mira paced the small room while Kai coaxed life from the ancient technology. Her mind returned to the off-schedule drone patrol. Haven security didn't change patterns randomly. Something had prompted increased surveillance in that sector.

"Interesting," Kai murmured.

Mira turned. "You got in?"

"Partial access. The primary storage is encrypted, but the diagnostic partition is readable." Kai's eyes reflected the blue glow of his screen. "This drive belonged to the Sofia Institute for Climate Research."

The name sent a jolt through Mira. "The Sofia Institute? Are you sure?"

Kai nodded. "Their digital signature is all over the diagnostic logs. Last access date... March 2063."

Mira moved beside him, staring at the screen. The Sofia Institute had been legendary among environmental scientists—including her parents. Founded in the 2050s, it had produced the most accurate climate models of the pre-flood era. Models that had predicted the Acceleration phase with frightening precision.

Models that had been publicly dismissed as "alarmist" by the very corporations now controlling the Haven cities.

"Can you decrypt the main storage?" Mira asked, trying to keep the urgency from her voice.

Kai gave her a sidelong glance. "This isn't just about salvage value for you, is it?"

Mira hesitated. Kai was as close to a friend as she allowed herself, but she compartmentalized her life by necessity. Her salvage work. Her revenge mission. Her Tide Caller identity. Separate boxes, rarely opened in front of others.

But she needed his help.

"My parents worked with the Sofia Institute," she said finally. "Before the Acceleration. Their research was suppressed, their warnings ignored. When the flooding worsened, they were among the scientists trying to evacuate coastal communities." She swallowed. "They didn't make it out themselves."

Understanding dawned in Kai's eyes. "And you think this drive might contain evidence of who suppressed their research."

"It's possible." Mira tapped the drive's casing. "The Sofia Institute was mysteriously acquired and dissolved in late 2063. Their research vanished. Their scientists scattered—or disappeared."

Kai turned back to his terminal, fingers moving with renewed purpose. "Decryption will take time. These quantum storage systems used cutting-edge security protocols. I'll need to build a custom cracking algorithm."

"How long?"

"Days, maybe weeks." He glanced up at her frown. "I can give you preliminary results sooner. The encryption likely has layers—less sensitive data might be accessible before the core files."

Mira nodded. "Do what you can. I'll pay double your usual rate."

Kai waved this off. "Keep your credits. This one's personal." His expression darkened. "My family lived in Bangladesh. The Acceleration took everything. If this drive contains evidence against the people responsible..." He left the sentence unfinished.

A chime sounded from above—someone entering Kai's stall.

"Go," he said. "Use the back exit. I'll contact you when I have something."

Mira squeezed his shoulder in silent thanks before slipping through a narrow doorway that led to a service corridor. As the door closed behind her, she heard Kai ascending to greet his customer, his voice shifting effortlessly into his public persona—just another Tide Dweller trader, nothing special to see.

The service corridor connected to Tidefall's maintenance network—a labyrinthine system of passages that ran through the repurposed structures. Originally designed for university maintenance staff, these corridors now served the engineers and technicians who kept the floating settlement functioning.

Mira's credentials identified her as an oceanographic researcher with maintenance access—a cover identity carefully constructed over years. It granted her movement between Tidefall's social tiers without raising suspicion.

She emerged near the residential section where her small apartment was located. The eastern sky was lightening, painting the endless ocean in shades of pink and gold. Mira paused at a viewing platform, watching the sun rise over a world that was both familiar and alien to the one her parents had known.

Seventy-five meters of sea level rise had transformed Earth's geography. Coastlines her parents had studied existed now only in digital archives and fading memories. New ecosystems had emerged in the flooded urban landscapes. Humanity had adapted—some rising to floating luxury in the Havens, others clinging to whatever remained above water.

The water remembered what people forgot. But Mira remembered too.

She continued to her apartment—a modest space that reflected her cover identity. Oceanographic instruments and research materials occupied most surfaces. Books on marine biology and climate science filled the shelves. Nothing to suggest her true mission or abilities.

After securing her door, Mira pressed her palm against a section of wall that appeared identical to the rest. A hidden compartment slid open, revealing her real work. Maps marking corporate executives' locations and movements. Salvaged documents connecting companies to climate research suppression. Profiles of Haven security protocols and vulnerabilities.

And at the center, a faded photograph of her family—Mira at twelve years old, flanked by her parents outside the university where they'd taught. Their last photo together, taken weeks before the evacuation that separated them forever.

Mira added a note about the Sofia Institute drive to her encrypted journal, then closed the compartment. She stripped off her salvage clothes and stepped into her shower, letting the carefully rationed water wash away the dive's physical remnants.

As the water flowed over her skin, she felt the familiar connection—the molecules responding subtly to her presence, their movement aligning with her breathing. She allowed herself this small indulgence, this moment of being truly herself, before shutting off the water and returning to her public persona.

A notification chimed from her comm unit. Mira wrapped herself in a towel and checked the message.

```
From: Dr. Reyes
Subject: Urgent consultation
Need your expertise on anomalous current patterns. My office, 0900 today.
Found something you should see.
```

Dr. Reyes—one of the few surviving scientists from her parents' generation. Officially, he consulted with Mira on her oceanographic research. Unofficially, he provided historical context and connections that couldn't be found in Haven-controlled archives.

If he'd found something urgent enough to risk an early morning message, it was significant.

Mira dressed quickly in the practical clothing of a Tide Dweller researcher—durable fabric in muted blues and grays, multiple pockets for instruments, waterproof boots. She braided her dark hair, weaving in the subtle blue strands that marked her to other Tide Callers without alerting Haven authorities.

The morning crowds were thickening as she made her way through Tidefall's central marketplace. The massive spiral sculpture that had once graced the university's courtyard now served as the hub's centerpiece and primary landmark. Tide Dwellers, Haven visitors, and even some Drowned with trading permits converged here, creating a temporary illusion of social fluidity.

Mira navigated through the crowd, maintaining the alert-but-not-anxious demeanor that avoided attention. Haven security drones hovered at the marketplace perimeter, their cameras constantly scanning for prohibited technology, unregistered Tide Callers, or signs of dissent.

Dr. Reyes's office was located in what had once been the university's marine science building—now repurposed as a research center that served Haven interests while maintaining a veneer of academic independence. The elderly scientist was waiting when she arrived, his thin frame hunched over a holographic display.

"Close the door," he said without looking up.

Mira complied, noting the unusual tension in his voice. "What's wrong?"

"Everything." Dr. Reyes deactivated the display and turned to face her. His eyes, magnified by thick glasses, held an intensity that belied his fragile appearance. "I was contacted by an old colleague yesterday. Someone I thought was dead."

He gestured for Mira to sit, then activated a signal jammer—a serious security violation if discovered by Haven authorities.

"Twenty years ago, I worked with a team studying early indicators of the Acceleration phase. Your parents were part of that network." He removed his glasses, rubbing the bridge of his nose. "There was another team at the Sofia Institute developing predictive models."

Mira's pulse quickened. "The Sofia Institute? I just—" She stopped herself.

Dr. Reyes nodded as if she'd confirmed something. "You found something from the Institute. I suspected as much when I saw the Haven security alert about increased salvage activity in the financial district."

"What alert?"

"Internal Haven communication. Not public." He replaced his glasses. "I still have sources. The point is, you're not the only one looking for Sofia Institute data."

He activated a secure tablet, sliding it across the desk to Mira. On the screen was a corporate memo—recent, dated just three days ago.

```
FROM: V. Reeves
TO: Security Division
SUBJECT: Project Watershed Historical Data

Increase surveillance in Grid Sectors 7-F through 9-F. Intelligence suggests Sofia Institute backup servers may be located in these areas. Any salvage operators discovered in these sectors are to be detained for questioning.

Priority level: Alpha
Authorization code: VR-0117
```

Mira stared at the memo, her fingers tightening around the tablet. V. Reeves. Victor Reeves, CEO of Oceanic Solutions—one of the largest corporations to survive and thrive after the Deluge.

"Victor Reeves," she whispered.

"Yes." Dr. Reyes's voice was grim. "The same Victor Reeves who led the corporate coalition that discredited the Sofia Institute's research. The same Victor Reeves whose company acquired and dissolved the Institute in 2063."

He leaned forward. "And the same Victor Reeves who personally ordered the destruction of evacuation vessels during the New Valencia crisis."

The room seemed to tilt around Mira. "New Valencia? You mean—"

"Your parents' evacuation fleet. Yes." Dr. Reyes's eyes held a mixture of sorrow and rage. "I never told you because I couldn't prove it. But my colleague—the one who contacted me yesterday—she has evidence. Documentation that Oceanic Solutions security forces were instructed to prevent 'unauthorized evacuations' from coastal areas where they had research facilities."

"They wanted to control who got out," Mira said, her voice hollow. "To protect their intellectual property."

"And to silence scientists who knew too much." Dr. Reyes nodded. "New Valencia housed three research facilities with data that could have implicated major corporations in climate crimes. When the sea walls failed ahead of schedule, the evacuation became... inconvenient."

Mira's mind raced, connecting points she'd been gathering for years. The Sofia Institute. Victor Reeves. Oceanic Solutions. The quantum drive currently in Kai's possession.

"I need to see this evidence," she said.

"My colleague is cautious. She's been in hiding for decades." Dr. Reyes wrote a set of coordinates on a piece of paper—actual paper, untraceable. "Meet her here, tomorrow at midnight. Come alone, and make absolutely certain you're not followed."

Mira memorized the coordinates before destroying the paper. "Who is she?"

Dr. Reyes hesitated. "She was the Sofia Institute's lead researcher. The one who developed the models that predicted everything—the Acceleration, the Deluge, all of it with frightening accuracy." He swallowed. "Her name is Dr. Sophia Reeves."

Mira's eyes widened. "Reeves? As in—"

"Victor's wife. Yes." Dr. Reyes's expression was grim. "Officially, she died of a rare illness nineteen years ago. In reality, she faked her death after discovering what her husband had done. She's been gathering evidence ever since, waiting for the right moment."

"Why now?"

"Because of Project Watershed." Dr. Reyes deactivated the signal jammer, his time limit for secure conversation elapsed. In a more normal tone, he continued, "Those current anomalies I mentioned? They're not natural. Oceanic Solutions is testing something in the deep ocean trenches. Something that could alter global water patterns."

He handed her a data drive disguised as an oceanographic instrument. "Study these readings carefully, Ms. Voss. I believe you'll find them quite illuminating for your research."

Mira understood the return to their cover conversation. She took the drive, nodding professionally. "Thank you, Dr. Reyes. I'll analyze these right away."

As she left his office, Mira's mind whirled with implications. Victor Reeves was directly responsible for her parents' death. His company had suppressed the research that might have prevented the worst of the flooding. And now they were developing technology that could further manipulate the devastated world.

Most shocking of all, his supposedly dead wife was alive—in hiding, gathering evidence against her husband.

Mira had spent years searching for the people responsible for the climate catastrophe that orphaned her. Now she had a name, a face, a specific target for her revenge.

Victor Reeves would pay for what he'd done. And his mysterious Project Watershed might be the key to making him vulnerable.

As she walked through Tidefall's crowded pathways, Mira felt the water calling to her—from below the floating structures, from within the pipes and systems that sustained the settlement, from the very air's humidity. It resonated with her growing resolve.

The water remembered. And soon, everyone else would too.
