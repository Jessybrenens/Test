# Chapter 5: The Meeting

The coordinates led Mira to an abandoned desalination plant on the outskirts of Tidefall. Moonlight filtered through broken ceiling panels, casting silver patterns across rusted machinery. The air hung heavy with salt and decay, the scent of forgotten technology.

She arrived an hour early, using the time to scout the perimeter and establish three separate escape routes. Old habits from years of salvage operations in contested territories. The pendant containing Mediterranean water rested against her collarbone, a talisman connecting her to what had been lost.

At precisely midnight, Mira positioned herself with her back to a support column, the main entrance in view. The water pipes running through the facility hummed with her awareness, ready to respond if needed.

"You move like someone accustomed to being hunted."

The voice came from behind her—impossible, given her careful surveillance. Mira spun, hand instinctively reaching for the knife at her belt.

An elderly woman stood in a doorway that hadn't been there moments before. Or rather, Mira realized, a doorway that had been disguised as part of the wall. The woman's silver hair was pulled back in a severe bun, her posture straight despite her years. Her eyes, sharp and assessing, carried an intelligence that time hadn't diminished.

"Dr. Sophia Reeves," Mira said, forcing her hand away from her weapon.

The woman inclined her head slightly. "And you're Mira Voss. Elena and David's daughter." Her gaze softened momentarily. "You have your mother's eyes."

The casual mention of her parents' names sent a jolt through Mira. Few people remembered them now, fewer still had known them personally.

"Dr. Reyes said you have evidence," Mira said, keeping her voice steady despite the emotions churning beneath. "About New Valencia. About my parents."

"I have evidence about many things." Sophia gestured toward the hidden doorway. "But we shouldn't linger here. Security drones have increased their patrol patterns recently."

Mira hesitated, years of caution warring with the need for answers. "How do I know this isn't a trap?"

A ghost of a smile crossed Sophia's face. "A reasonable question. Your mother asked the same thing when we first met." She reached into her pocket and withdrew a small object, offering it on her palm.

A weathered university ID badge. Elena Voss, Marine Biology Department. The photo showed a younger version of Mira's mother, smiling with the confidence of someone who believed science could save the world.

"She gave me this the day before the evacuation," Sophia said quietly. "For safekeeping, she said. I think she knew, somehow."

Mira took the badge, her fingers trembling slightly as they brushed against the laminated surface. The plastic was worn smooth from handling. Had Sophia carried this for twenty years, this small piece of her mother?

"Come," Sophia said, turning toward the hidden door. "We have much to discuss, and time has never been our ally."

The passage beyond led to a small but sophisticated living space carved from the desalination plant's former control room. Screens lined one wall, displaying data feeds and security camera views. A modest sleeping area occupied one corner, a workstation another. The space of someone who lived with purpose rather than comfort.

"You've been hiding here? In Tidefall?" Mira asked, taking in the surroundings. "All these years?"

"Not continuously," Sophia replied, moving to a console and entering a complex sequence. "I maintain several safe locations throughout what remains of the Pacific Rim. This one is... convenient for current purposes."

The largest screen flickered to life, displaying a map of ocean current patterns. Mira recognized it immediately as similar to the one Victor Reeves had shown during the Haven gathering.

"Project Watershed," she said.

Sophia's expression hardened. "Victor's obsession. His attempt to play god with what remains of our world." She manipulated the display, zooming in on the North Pacific installation. "But I'm getting ahead of myself. You came for answers about the past, not warnings about the future."

She gestured to a chair, taking one herself. For a moment, the composed facade slipped, revealing the weight of decades.

"I met your parents in 2095, during the early Acceleration phase," Sophia began. "The Sofia Institute had developed models predicting catastrophic sea level rise, but we needed field data to refine our projections. Elena and David were among the scientists brave enough to continue their research as the waters rose."

Mira leaned forward. "The Sofia Institute—your name."

A nod. "My life's work, before Victor destroyed it." Bitterness edged her voice. "We were close, once. Believed in the same things. He funded the Institute's early research, championed our findings." Her fingers traced an invisible pattern on the table. "Until the projections became too dire, the implications too damaging to corporate interests."

"What changed him?"

"Power. Money. Fear, perhaps." Sophia's gaze grew distant. "Our models predicted not just environmental collapse but societal upheaval. The corporations that had profited from climate destruction would be held accountable. Victor chose self-preservation."

She tapped a command, bringing up a new document on the screen. "This is the suppression order he issued in 2063. The beginning of the end for the Sofia Institute."

Mira recognized it immediately—the same memo she'd seen in Dr. Reyes's office. The confirmation that Victor Reeves had personally ordered the destruction of climate research that might have prevented the worst of the Deluge.

"By 2097, the Acceleration had surpassed even our most pessimistic models," Sophia continued. "Coastal evacuations were underway worldwide. Your parents were coordinating the scientific community's response in New Valencia."

Her voice grew softer. "What you may not know is that New Valencia housed a research facility containing evidence of corporate climate crimes—including Oceanic Solutions' early experiments with weather modification technology."

"The precursor to Project Watershed," Mira said, pieces connecting in her mind.

"Yes. Victor couldn't allow that research to reach the public. So he made a decision." Sophia's eyes met Mira's, unflinching. "He ordered Oceanic Solutions security forces to prevent 'unauthorized evacuations' from the New Valencia region."

She brought up another document—a security directive with Victor's signature and authorization code.

"They disabled the evacuation vessels' navigation systems," Sophia said. "When the sea wall failed ahead of schedule, the ships were trapped in the harbor. Twenty-three vessels. Over four thousand people."

Including her parents. Mira's throat tightened, grief and rage twisting together into something molten. "They murdered them to protect corporate secrets."

"Yes." The simple confirmation carried the weight of absolute certainty.

"And you've been gathering evidence since then," Mira said. "Why not release it? Why hide for twenty years?"

Sophia's expression shifted, revealing a calculation behind her grief. "Evidence without leverage is just history, Mira. The Haven corporations control information flow. They would discredit any accusations, bury any evidence." Her hand clenched into a fist. "I needed something more. A way to force accountability."

"Project Watershed," Mira realized. "You've been monitoring Victor's work."

"For years." Sophia stood, moving to the main display. "The project itself is based partly on my research—twisted and weaponized. Victor believes he's creating a system to control ocean currents, to manage what remains of our world."

Her finger traced the installation points on the map. "What he doesn't know is that the system is fundamentally flawed. The energy requirements alone make it unsustainable, but more critically, the current manipulations will create cascading instabilities in global weather patterns."

"You're saying it won't work?"

"Oh, it will work," Sophia said grimly. "For a time. Long enough for Haven to consolidate control over remaining resources. But within five years, the system will begin to fail catastrophically. The resulting current disruptions would trigger hyperstorms beyond anything we've seen since the Deluge."

Mira absorbed this, the implications staggering. "Another catastrophe, with Haven controlling who survives."

"Precisely." Sophia's eyes held a fierce determination. "Which is why we must stop it before the network is complete. The North Pacific installation is operational but isolated. If we can access its control systems, we can demonstrate the fatal flaws in the project while simultaneously releasing the evidence of past climate crimes."

"We?" Mira asked.

"I've been building a network. People who remember the truth, who have skills and access." Sophia studied Mira with new intensity. "Your abilities as a Tide Caller would be invaluable. The installation is underwater, heavily guarded against conventional approaches."

Mira touched her pendant, considering. "You knew what I am."

"Your mother told me, before the end. She was proud of you, Mira. Saw your connection to water as evolution, not aberration." Sophia's voice softened. "She believed Tide Callers represented humanity's adaptation to the world we created."

The mention of her mother's acceptance eased something in Mira's chest, a tension she'd carried for years.

"There's something else you should know," Sophia said after a moment. "About Elian."

"Your son." Mira kept her expression neutral, though her pulse quickened.

"He doesn't know I'm alive." Pain flickered across Sophia's face. "I've watched him from afar, seen him grow into someone who questions his father's methods. He's positioned himself as Project Director to moderate Victor's ambitions, but he doesn't understand the fundamental flaws."

"You want to recruit him too," Mira realized.

"He has access we need. Knowledge of the system architecture." Sophia's gaze was steady. "And he deserves to know the truth about his father. About me."

Mira thought of her encounter with Elian at the Haven gathering. His environmental concerns had seemed genuine, his invitation unexpected. Was it possible he was already seeking allies against his father's project?

"I met him," Mira admitted. "At a Haven gathering. He invited me to consult on Project Watershed's environmental impact assessments."

Surprise registered on Sophia's face, quickly replaced by calculation. "That's... unexpected. And potentially valuable." She studied Mira with new interest. "What impression did you form of him?"

"Conflicted," Mira said honestly. "Intelligent. Possibly genuine in his environmental concerns. But still his father's son."

"Not entirely," Sophia murmured. "Not where it matters most." She straightened, decision made. "This changes our approach. Your connection to Elian provides an entry point we didn't have before."

"You want me to use him," Mira stated flatly.

"I want you to give him a chance to choose the right side of history." Sophia's voice hardened. "The same chance I never gave his father."

The implications hung between them—personal revenge versus global stakes, past wrongs versus future catastrophe.

"What exactly are you proposing?" Mira asked finally.

"Accept his invitation. Gain his trust. Assess whether he can be brought into our effort." Sophia's expression was unyielding. "If he can, we'll proceed with his help. If not, we have alternative approaches."

Mira considered the proposal, weighing it against her years of planning. Her goal had always been Victor Reeves's downfall, justice for her parents and countless others. Sophia offered a path to that justice, but one that involved Elian Reeves in ways Mira hadn't anticipated.

"And if I refuse?"

"Then we proceed without you," Sophia said simply. "But with less chance of success, and greater risk to those involved."

The weight of decision pressed on Mira. Her parents' faces flashed in her memory—not from photographs, but from her last sight of them, determined and afraid as they helped others onto evacuation vessels that would never escape the harbor.

"I'll do it," she said finally. "But I need to know everything—about Project Watershed, about Victor's security, about your network."

Relief flickered across Sophia's face. "Of course. We begin immediately." She activated another screen. "First, you should understand the full scope of what we're facing."

As Sophia outlined the details of Project Watershed's architecture and vulnerabilities, Mira felt a shift in her purpose. For years, she'd focused on exposing the truth about the past. Now she faced a choice between vengeance for what had been lost and protection of what remained.

The water remembered. But perhaps it was time to focus on the future it would shape.
