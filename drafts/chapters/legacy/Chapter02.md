# Chapter 2: The Heir

Elian Reeves stood at the floor-to-ceiling window of his father's office, watching the sunset paint Celestia Haven in shades of gold and crimson. From this height—the 137th floor of Oceanic Solutions' headquarters—the floating city resembled an elaborate jewel set upon the endless blue. His fingertips pressed against the glass, leaving smudges that would horrify the overnight cleaning staff.

"You're not listening to me, son."

Elian's shoulders tensed before he turned. Victor Reeves sat behind a desk of salvaged redwood, one of the last old-growth trees harvested before they vanished beneath the rising waters. At sixty-three, Victor's presence filled the room—silver hair precisely cut, spine straight as a carbon rod, eyes that could strip away pretense like acid.

"I heard every word, Father," Elian replied, forcing his voice to remain steady despite the familiar tightness in his chest. "The southern agricultural platform needs expansion. The Tide Dweller labor dispute requires resolution. The Haven Council seeks our support for increased security measures." He paused, swallowing the sarcasm that threatened to surface. "Did I miss anything?"

Victor's expression didn't change, but Elian caught the slight narrowing of his eyes—the microscopic tell that had cost countless negotiators their advantage over the years.

"You heard. But you weren't listening." Victor jabbed a finger at the holographic report hovering above his desk, sending ripples through the projection. "These security measures aren't just bureaucratic overreach. Tide Caller infiltration increased twenty-seven percent last quarter. They're becoming bolder, more organized."

Elian's jaw clenched. "Perhaps because Haven security keeps abducting them for 'research purposes'?"

"Study," Victor corrected, his voice dropping to that dangerous quiet that had preceded the dismantling of entire corporate boards. "Not abduction. These genetic anomalies could provide valuable insights. Adaptations we might harness."

"They're people, Father. Not specimens."

Victor's hand sliced through the air, dismissing the objection like an insect. "People with abilities that give them unfair advantages in a water-dominated world. Abilities they hide while infiltrating our society." He leaned forward, the desk creaking beneath his palms. "Your sympathy for the lower tiers is admirable in theory, Elian, but misplaced in practice. Our position requires pragmatism."

The familiar argument settled between them like a third presence in the room. Elian's throat burned with unspoken rebuttals. He changed tactics instead, sliding his hands into his pockets to hide their trembling.

"Speaking of pragmatism, I've been reviewing the Watershed Project files you granted me access to."

Interest flickered in Victor's eyes, the bait taken. "And?"

"The theoretical framework is sound, but the power requirements are prohibitive. We'd need to divert resources from three Haven sectors for initial testing alone."

"A temporary inconvenience for a permanent solution," Victor said, the words practiced, polished. "If we could control water levels globally—"

"We'd be playing god," Elian finished. "Again."

The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees. Victor's face hardened into the expression that had launched a thousand corporate takeovers.

"The first time wasn't playing god. It was survival." Victor stood, his chair rolling back with a soft hiss. He moved to the window, standing close enough that Elian could smell the sandalwood cologne his father had worn since before the floods. "Look at what we built from the ruins, son. Celestia Haven houses fifty thousand people in comfort and security. Our agricultural platforms feed millions. Our desalination technology provides clean water to even the Drowned communities."

Elian had heard this speech so many times he could recite it in his sleep. The corporate savior narrative that Haven children learned instead of history. The justification for every atrocity committed in the name of survival.

"I understand the project's potential benefits," Elian said, choosing each word like he was disarming a bomb. "I'm merely suggesting we consider less invasive approaches first. The restoration initiatives I've proposed—"

"Band-aids," Victor interrupted, his contempt palpable. "Your restoration projects might green a few rooftops or purify a few square kilometers of ocean, but they don't address the fundamental problem." He gestured toward the horizon, where the sun was slipping beneath the endless water, leaving a wound of red across the sky. "Seventy-five meters of sea level rise. Billions displaced. Entire nations erased. The world needs more than incremental improvements, Elian. It needs transformation."

The irony made Elian's stomach turn. The same corporations that had ignored climate warnings, suppressed research, and prioritized quarterly profits over planetary health now positioned themselves as humanity's only hope. His father genuinely believed in his vision—that was what made Victor so dangerous.

"I'll review the power requirement calculations again," Elian conceded, the words tasting bitter. "Perhaps there's an efficiency we've overlooked."

Victor's expression softened marginally. He placed a hand on Elian's shoulder—the weight of it both unfamiliar and overwhelming.

"You have your mother's heart, Elian. She always worried about the human cost too." Something flickered behind Victor's eyes—grief or guilt, quickly buried. "But remember what she used to say: 'Compassion without action is just sentiment.'"

The mention of his mother sent a familiar ache through Elian's chest, sharp as the day they'd sealed her tomb. Sophia Reeves had died when he was fourteen—a "rare autoimmune disorder" according to official records. Nineteen years later, her absence remained a wound that never fully healed.

"I remember," Elian said quietly. What Victor conveniently omitted was the rest of Sophia's saying: "And action without compassion is just cruelty."

Victor's comm unit chimed, breaking the moment. He checked the notification, his frown deepening the lines around his mouth.

"The Haven Council meeting has been moved up. We'll continue this discussion tomorrow." He straightened his already immaculate jacket, brushing away invisible dust. "I expect you at the Watershed Project review at 0900. Dr. Nakamura is presenting the latest simulation results."

Elian nodded. "I'll be there."

After Victor left, Elian remained by the window, watching the lights of Celestia Haven illuminate against the darkening sky. From this height, you couldn't see the barriers that separated the Haven elite from the Tide Dweller service class. You couldn't see the security drones that patrolled the perimeter, ensuring no unauthorized vessels approached. You certainly couldn't see the Drowned communities that clustered around the floating city's moorings, surviving on scraps from above.

His father saw a triumph of human ingenuity and corporate leadership. Elian saw a monument to inequality and selective memory.

He waited fifteen minutes, counting the seconds in his head, to ensure Victor was well on his way to the Council meeting before approaching his father's private terminal. As the CEO's son and heir apparent, Elian had extensive access privileges—though not unlimited. What he was about to do would be considered corporate espionage at best, treason at worst.

"James," he spoke into his personal comm unit, his voice barely above a whisper despite being alone. "Is the path clear?"

"Yes, sir," his assistant replied promptly. "Your father's transport left the dock three minutes ago. Security cameras on the executive floor are running the loop program for the next twenty minutes—standard privacy protocol during your father's absence."

"Thank you. Please ensure I'm not disturbed."

"Of course, sir. Your 'deep work' status has been activated in the building system."

Elian's lips curved into a half-smile. James had been with him for five years—initially assigned by Victor to report on his activities, a fact both men acknowledged openly now. Over time, James had seen enough to make his own decisions about where his true loyalties should lie.

Elian placed his palm on the terminal's biometric scanner, his heartbeat quickening as the cool surface read his prints. The system recognized him, but a secondary authentication screen appeared—one requesting a password for the restricted archives. He entered the code he'd obtained by carefully observing his father's keystrokes during a moment of distraction last week.

The screen flashed green. His breath caught. Access granted.

Elian navigated quickly to the historical archives—specifically, the pre-flood corporate records that had been digitized and preserved. Most Haven residents believed these records had been lost during the Deluge. In reality, the corporations had maintained meticulous backups of anything that might prove useful or incriminating.

He searched for files related to the climate research suppression of the 2060s—the decade when the Acceleration phase might still have been prevented. Most files were heavily redacted or encrypted beyond his current capabilities. But occasionally, he found fragments that slipped through the censors.

A memo from 2063 caught his attention. His hands grew cold as he read:

FROM: V. Reeves
TO: Executive Committee
SUBJECT: Sofia Institute Findings

The SI projections must not reach regulatory agencies. Containment protocol Alpha is authorized. Dr. Voss and her team require special handling. Plausible deniability essential.

Recommendation: Acquisition of SI through shell corporation followed by immediate dissolution. Research materials to be secured in deep storage facility 9.

This communication will self-delete in 24 hours.

Elian stared at the screen, his heart hammering against his ribs. Dr. Voss. The name meant nothing to him, but the implications were clear. His father had personally ordered the suppression of climate research—research that might have prevented or mitigated the catastrophe that followed.

And "special handling" was corporate euphemism for something far darker than simple termination of employment.

He quickly copied the file to his secure drive, fingers trembling slightly as they moved across the interface. Another document appeared—a fragment of a larger report:

...genetic adaptations observed in approximately 0.03% of test subjects exposed to compound SX-7 during trials. Adaptations include enhanced pressure resistance, oxygen efficiency, and limited hydrokinetic capabilities. Subjects display distinctive dermal markings resembling scales...

The document was dated 2097—during the height of the Deluge. Elian's stomach twisted. This aligned with the emergence of the first Tide Callers, but contradicted the official narrative that their abilities were spontaneous mutations caused by environmental stress.

If Tide Callers were the result of corporate experimentation...

A soft chime interrupted his thoughts—James's warning that his window was closing. Elian quickly copied the fragment and closed the terminal, erasing all traces of his search with practiced efficiency.

He straightened his jacket and composed his features into the mask of the dutiful corporate heir—a mask he'd worn for so long it sometimes felt fused to his skin. By the time he left the office, not even the most sophisticated emotional recognition software would have detected anything amiss in his demeanor.

But inside, his mind raced with implications and connections. The climate research suppression. His mother's mysterious illness. The Tide Caller origins. The Watershed Project. Pieces of a puzzle he'd been assembling for years, each new fragment revealing a picture more disturbing than he'd imagined.

His private transport waited at the executive dock, its sleek lines gleaming under the artificial lighting. As he settled into the plush interior, the scent of real leather—another pre-flood luxury—surrounded him. He activated his secure communication device—one unknown to Haven security or his father's surveillance.

"Dr. Chen," he said when the connection established, his voice low despite the transport's soundproofing. "I've found something you should see. Can you meet tonight?"

"The usual place?" The elderly archivist's voice crackled through the encrypted channel, fragile yet determined.

"Yes. And Dr. Chen? Be careful. I think we're getting close to something they'll kill to protect."

He ended the transmission and gazed out at Celestia Haven as his transport navigated between gleaming towers. The beautiful floating city, built on secrets as much as on advanced engineering. His home. His inheritance. His burden.

Elian Reeves, heir to Oceanic Solutions, was committing treason against everything his father had built. And he was just getting started.
