# Chapter 10: The Confrontation

The project review chamber occupied the heart of the station's administrative level, its circular design reminiscent of corporate boardrooms in Celestia Haven. Holographic displays lined the walls, currently showing the modulation field's real-time effects on surrounding ocean currents. The central table, an oval of polished recycled materials, seated twenty, with Victor Reeves positioned at its head.

Mira entered precisely at 0800, maintaining the professional demeanor expected of Dr. Marina Voss, oceanographic consultant. She nodded to several staff members she'd met during her first days at the station, noting the tension evident in their postures. Word of Victor's accelerated timeline had clearly spread.

Elian arrived moments later, his expression carefully neutral as he took his place opposite his father. Their eyes met briefly across the room—a silent confirmation of their strategy. The data he'd transferred to her quarters terminal the previous night had confirmed their worst fears about the boundary instabilities.

"Let's begin," Victor announced once all participants were seated. "As you know, Project Watershed has reached a critical milestone. The North Pacific station has demonstrated consistent performance within operational parameters for six consecutive months."

Holographic displays shifted to show performance metrics—all carefully curated to support Victor's narrative of success. Mira noted the absence of boundary stability data among the highlighted statistics.

"Based on these results, the Haven Board of Directors has approved accelerated implementation of the Atlantic installation." Victor's voice carried the confidence of someone accustomed to having his declarations accepted without question. "Construction begins in three weeks, with operational status projected within two months."

Murmurs rippled around the table—surprise from some, concern from others. Dr. Chen, the operations director, leaned forward. "Sir, the integration testing protocols require at least six weeks of calibration before network synchronization can begin."

"The protocols have been modified," Victor replied dismissively. "Our engineers have developed a streamlined approach that will allow for concurrent calibration and integration."

"With respect, Mr. Reeves," Dr. Nakamura interjected, "concurrent processes increase the risk of systemic instabilities. The modulation field is sensitive to—"

"The decision has been made, Doctor." Victor's tone hardened slightly. "Haven leadership recognizes the urgency of expanding Project Watershed's benefits to the Atlantic region. Technical concerns will be addressed within the accelerated timeline."

Mira watched the exchange with interest, noting how quickly Victor shut down legitimate scientific objections. His leadership style left no room for dissent, even from his senior technical staff.

Elian caught her eye and gave an almost imperceptible nod. Time for their planned intervention.

"Mr. Reeves," Mira said, her voice carrying the measured authority of Dr. Voss's academic credentials. "My preliminary analysis of the environmental data suggests caution might be warranted before network expansion."

Victor's gaze shifted to her, his expression cooling. "Dr. Voss. Your consultation was requested for environmental impact assessment, not implementation timelines."

"The two are connected," Mira replied evenly. "The boundary oscillation patterns show concerning trends that could have significant environmental implications, particularly in a networked configuration."

"Boundary oscillations are a known phenomenon, well within manageable parameters," Victor dismissed. "Dr. Chen's team has implemented compensation algorithms specifically designed to address them."

"The algorithms address symptom, not cause," Elian interjected, activating his own display. "Dr. Voss's observations align with concerns I've been documenting for months. The oscillations are increasing in amplitude despite the compensation measures."

The display showed a time-series analysis of boundary stability metrics—data Elian had provided to Mira the previous night, now presented officially for the first time.

"These readings suggest fundamental resonance effects that could amplify when the Atlantic station comes online," Elian continued. "Creating a network before we fully understand these dynamics introduces unnecessary risk."

Victor's expression hardened as he studied his son. "Risk is inherent in progress, Director Reeves. Your environmental concerns have been noted and addressed in the implementation plan."

"Have they?" Elian challenged, unusual defiance in his tone. "Because the data suggests otherwise. The compensation algorithms are failing to prevent amplitude increase. Projecting current trends forward, we could see critical instability within months of network activation."

The room had grown uncomfortably quiet, the confrontation between father and son creating a tension that transcended normal corporate disagreement. Mira seized the opportunity to reinforce Elian's point.

"My analysis supports Director Reeves's concerns," she said, activating her own display to show the environmental models she'd developed overnight. "These simulations indicate potential hyperstorm formation in convergence zones if the boundary instabilities continue to amplify."

The holographic projection showed swirling weather patterns developing at the edges of the modulation field, growing in intensity as the simulation progressed until they coalesced into massive storm systems unlike anything seen since the worst days of the Acceleration.

"This is speculative modeling based on worst-case assumptions," Victor countered, though Mira noted a flicker of something—concern, perhaps—cross his features. "Dr. Nakamura, your assessment?"

The environmental systems director studied the simulation with a frown. "The model appears technically sound, though I would need to review the underlying assumptions. If accurate, it suggests a non-trivial risk of weather pattern destabilization."

"More than non-trivial," Elian pressed. "Catastrophic. And the Atlantic installation would create additional boundary zones, multiplying the effect."

Victor's jaw tightened. "These concerns will be addressed by the engineering team before the Atlantic station becomes operational. The timeline stands."

"Father," Elian said, his voice lowering slightly, "we're talking about potential weather pattern collapse across two ocean basins. Millions of lives could be at risk if these projections are accurate."

"And millions benefit from the stability Project Watershed provides," Victor countered. "Your environmental idealism continues to cloud your judgment, Elian. The Haven Board has reviewed all relevant data and approved the accelerated timeline."

"All relevant data?" Elian's expression hardened. "Or only the data that supports your predetermined conclusion?"

The challenge hung in the air, more personal than professional. Mira watched the exchange with growing tension, aware they were approaching dangerous territory. Elian was allowing his frustration to push him closer to revealing how much he knew about his father's manipulation of Project Watershed data.

"Perhaps," Mira interjected carefully, "a compromise position exists. Proceed with construction of the Atlantic installation while extending the testing and calibration phase to ensure these boundary concerns are fully addressed before network integration."

Victor's attention shifted back to her, his eyes narrowing slightly. "An interesting suggestion, Dr. Voss. Though I wonder why an external consultant would be so invested in our implementation timeline."

The subtle shift in his tone alerted Mira that she'd drawn unwanted attention. Victor Reeves was too shrewd to miss the coordination between her and his son.

"Professional thoroughness," she replied smoothly. "My reputation is built on accurate environmental assessment. I would be remiss not to highlight potential risks, particularly of this magnitude."

"Indeed." Victor studied her for a moment longer before addressing the room. "I appreciate the concerns raised. Dr. Chen, you will work with the engineering team to review the boundary stability data and provide a comprehensive assessment within 48 hours. Dr. Nakamura, please validate Dr. Voss's environmental models against our historical data."

He turned back to Mira. "Dr. Voss, I would appreciate a detailed report on your methodology and assumptions. My office will provide you with additional historical data to refine your analysis."

The response was measured, reasonable—and entirely tactical, Mira realized. Victor was neither dismissing their concerns nor altering his plans. He was simply creating the appearance of due diligence while maintaining his timeline.

"Of course," she agreed. "Though I would need access to the complete boundary stability dataset to provide a comprehensive assessment."

"Dr. Chen will ensure you receive appropriate data," Victor replied, the emphasis on "appropriate" not lost on Mira. Her access would remain limited to what Victor deemed necessary.

The meeting continued with technical updates from various department heads, but the tension remained palpable. Mira caught Elian watching his father with barely concealed frustration. Their strategy had created documented concerns but failed to slow Victor's accelerated timeline.

As the meeting concluded, Victor made a final announcement. "Given the importance of the Atlantic installation, I'll be personally overseeing the final preparations. Chief Larson will assume security oversight of this station during my absence. I depart for Celestia Haven tomorrow."

This was unexpected. Victor leaving the station created both opportunities and complications for their plans.

"Director Reeves," Victor continued, addressing his son, "you will remain here to manage ongoing operations. I expect daily reports on system performance and boundary stability metrics."

"Yes, sir," Elian replied, his tone professionally neutral despite the earlier confrontation.

As the meeting dispersed, Mira gathered her materials, careful to maintain her consultant persona. Victor approached her as she prepared to leave.

"Dr. Voss," he said, his voice carrying just far enough for her to hear. "A moment of your time."

Mira turned, meeting his gaze with professional composure. "Of course, Mr. Reeves."

"Your environmental models are quite sophisticated for someone who's had access to our systems for less than a week." His tone remained conversational, but his eyes had hardened. "Almost as if you were already familiar with the technology."

A warning flared in Mira's mind. Victor was probing, testing her cover story. "I've studied similar current manipulation systems in theoretical contexts. The principles translate, even if the scale is different."

"Similar systems?" Victor raised an eyebrow. "Project Watershed's approach is proprietary. There are no 'similar systems' in operation or academic literature."

Mira maintained her composure despite the trap he'd laid. "I was referring to the theoretical work on current manipulation from the pre-Deluge period. The Sofia Institute published several papers on the concept before its... dissolution."

The mention of the Sofia Institute caused a subtle tightening around Victor's eyes. "You've studied their work?"

"What survived, yes. It's relevant to understanding potential environmental impacts of modern applications." Mira held his gaze steadily. "Science builds on what came before, even when the original researchers are no longer with us."

The double meaning hung between them—a calculated risk on Mira's part. Victor studied her for a long moment before responding.

"Indeed it does, Dr. Voss. Though one must be careful not to build on flawed foundations." He smiled thinly. "I look forward to reviewing your detailed report before my departure. Good day."

As Victor walked away, Mira released a carefully controlled breath. The exchange had confirmed her suspicions—Victor knew exactly who she was, or at least suspected strongly enough to test her. Her cover wasn't completely blown, but it was compromised.

She would need to accelerate their plans before Victor could act on his suspicions.

---

"He knows." Mira kept her voice low despite the signal dampening field active in Elian's office. "Or strongly suspects. He deliberately mentioned the Sofia Institute to gauge my reaction."

Elian paced the small space, tension evident in his movements. "Not surprising. My father rarely invites external consultants, and never without thorough background investigation. The question is why he hasn't acted yet."

"He's gathering evidence," Mira suggested. "Making sure before he moves against me."

"Or he's waiting to see who you're working with." Elian stopped pacing, turning to face her. "Including whether I'm involved."

The possibility hung between them—that Victor suspected his own son of collaboration with Mira. Given their interaction during the project review, the suspicion wouldn't be unreasonable.

"His departure for Celestia Haven complicates things," Mira said. "We lose access to him, but gain freedom of movement within the station."

"It's not that simple." Elian activated his terminal, bringing up the station's security protocols. "Chief Larson is completely loyal to my father. The surveillance will increase, not decrease, during his absence."

"Then we need to move quickly." Mira touched her pendant, feeling the water respond to her tension. "The data from the project review confirms what Sophia suspected—the boundary instabilities are worsening, and network expansion would trigger catastrophic weather patterns."

"We need more than confirmation," Elian replied. "We need proof that my father knows about the risks and is proceeding anyway. Without that, Haven leadership could claim ignorance and continue the project under different management."

Mira considered this. "The evidence must exist in the station's secure archives. Records of early testing, risk assessments, executive decisions to proceed despite known dangers."

"Those archives require executive-level clearance." Elian's expression grew thoughtful. "My access is limited to project management systems, not executive records."

"But your father has full access," Mira pointed out. "From his private terminal."

Elian's eyes met hers, understanding dawning. "Which will be unoccupied during his trip to Celestia Haven."

"Exactly." Mira leaned forward. "How difficult would it be to access his private quarters while he's gone?"

"Nearly impossible through standard means. The security systems are biometric, keyed to his specific signatures." Elian frowned. "Even as his son, I don't have authorization."

"What about non-standard means?" Mira asked. "Maintenance access? Emergency protocols?"

Elian considered this. "There's a maintenance conduit that runs behind the executive quarters for environmental system access. Theoretically, someone could enter through there, but it would trigger alerts unless the security system was already compromised."

"Could you compromise it?"

"Not directly." Elian hesitated, then made a decision. "But I know someone who might be able to help. Dr. Imani Okafor, our systems integration specialist. She's designed most of the station's environmental controls and has access to the maintenance systems."

"Can she be trusted?" Mira asked, caution in her voice.

"I believe so. She's expressed concerns about the boundary instabilities privately. And she lost family in coastal flooding during the Acceleration." Elian's expression grew determined. "I can approach her carefully, gauge her willingness to help without revealing our full intentions."

Mira nodded slowly. "Do it. But be careful. If your father suspects you're involved with me, he may be monitoring your interactions with other staff members."

"I know how to avoid surveillance," Elian assured her. "I've had years of practice."

The reminder of Elian's long-standing investigation into his father's activities reinforced Mira's growing trust in him. He had been gathering evidence against Victor Reeves long before she arrived, driven by his own ethical concerns rather than external pressure.

"There's something else," Mira said after a moment. "Something I need to tell you about the network I'm working with."

Elian's expression grew cautious. "What about them?"

Mira hesitated. This disclosure wasn't hers to make, strictly speaking. Sophia had been clear that revealing her survival should be her decision alone. But circumstances had changed. Victor's accelerated timeline and suspicion of Mira's true identity created new urgency.

And Elian deserved to know the truth about his mother.

"The leader of our network," Mira began carefully, "is someone you know. Someone you believe died years ago."

Elian went very still, his eyes fixed on hers. "What are you saying?"

"Your mother didn't die in a research vessel accident." Mira held his gaze steadily. "Sophia Reeves survived. She's been leading the resistance against Haven's climate crimes from hiding for the past twenty years."

The color drained from Elian's face. For several seconds, he simply stared at Mira, processing her words. When he finally spoke, his voice was barely audible.

"My mother is alive?"

"Yes." Mira watched him carefully, uncertain how he would react to this revelation. "She founded our network after faking her death to escape your father's attempts to silence her warnings about Project Watershed's dangers."

Elian turned away, moving to the viewport. His reflection in the glass showed a complex mixture of emotions—shock, disbelief, hope, anger. "All this time," he whispered. "All this time, I thought..."

"She wanted to contact you," Mira said gently. "But it wasn't safe—for either of you. Victor would have used you to get to her."

"And now?" Elian asked, still facing the viewport. "Why tell me now?"

"Because we're running out of time. The Atlantic installation will create catastrophic instabilities if it comes online. We need to work together—all of us—to stop it." Mira paused. "And because you deserve to know the truth before we proceed further."

Elian remained silent for a long moment, his shoulders tense. Then he turned back to face her, his expression transformed by a new determination.

"I want to speak with her."

"That can be arranged," Mira said. "But it's risky while we're on the station. Communications are monitored."

"I don't care about the risk." Elian's voice carried an intensity Mira hadn't heard before. "Twenty years, Mira. Twenty years believing she was dead. I need to hear her voice."

Mira nodded, understanding his need. "I have a secure communication device that can bypass the station's monitoring systems. Short transmission only, to avoid detection. We can try tonight, when security rotations create a brief surveillance gap."

"Thank you." The words carried more weight than their simplicity suggested. Elian took a deep breath, visibly pulling himself back to their immediate concerns. "This changes things. If my mother has been investigating Project Watershed all these years, she must have accumulated significant evidence."

"She has," Mira confirmed. "Including original research from the Sofia Institute proving the fundamental flaws in the modulation technology. But we need current operational data and executive decisions to create an irrefutable case."

"Which we can only get from my father's private terminal." Elian's focus sharpened, personal shock giving way to tactical thinking. "I'll speak with Dr. Okafor today. If she's willing to help, we could access my father's quarters tomorrow night after his departure."

"That timeline works," Mira agreed. "I can use my Tide Caller abilities to sense surveillance patterns and identify the safest moment to move."

Elian nodded, then asked the question Mira had been expecting. "Does my father know? About my mother's survival?"

"We don't think so," Mira replied carefully. "Sophia has been extremely cautious, operating through intermediaries and maintaining deep cover. If Victor suspected she was alive, he would have devoted Haven's full resources to finding her."

"Unless he's playing a longer game," Elian suggested, his understanding of his father's strategic thinking evident. "Waiting for her to reveal herself through her network's activities."

The possibility sent a chill through Mira. If Victor had somehow discovered Sophia's survival and was monitoring her network rather than moving against it immediately, they could all be walking into a trap.

"All the more reason to move quickly," she said. "Before he can connect all the pieces."

Elian agreed, his expression resolute despite the emotional shock he'd just experienced. "I'll make contact with Dr. Okafor and report back through the secure channel you established. We should avoid meeting again until the operation."

As Mira prepared to leave, Elian stopped her with a question. "Why did you come? Of all the people in my mother's network, why send you specifically?"

Mira touched her pendant, feeling the Mediterranean water respond to her awareness. "Because I have abilities that can help navigate Haven security. Because I have personal motivation to see justice for New Valencia. And because..." She hesitated, then decided on honesty. "Because your mother thought you might trust me. The daughter of scientists your father silenced, seeking the same truth you've been pursuing for years."

Elian studied her for a long moment. "She was right." He extended his hand. "Whatever happens next, I'm glad you're the one who came."

Mira accepted the handshake, noting the strength in his grip and the new resolve in his eyes. The revelation about his mother had changed him—adding personal stakes to what had already been an ethical mission.

As she left his office, Mira felt the weight of their accelerated timeline. Victor's departure created a narrow window of opportunity, but his suspicions meant the risks had increased significantly. If they failed to gather the evidence before his return, they might not get another chance.

And if Project Watershed's Atlantic installation proceeded as planned, the environmental catastrophe Sophia had predicted for decades would become inevitable.

---

Sophia Reeves stood at the viewport of the submersible vessel, watching the dark waters of the North Pacific slide past. Twenty years in hiding had etched lines into her face that hadn't been present in the recording Kai had discovered, but her eyes retained the same intensity—the unwavering focus of someone who had dedicated her life to a single purpose.

"Proximity alert," Selene announced from the navigation console. "We're approaching Haven security perimeter, ten kilometers from the station."

"Hold position," Sophia ordered. "Maintain passive scanning only. We can't risk detection."

The submersible—a modified research vessel with experimental stealth technology—slowed to a stop, hovering in the darkness at the edge of Project Watershed's security zone. From this position, they could monitor communications and deploy intervention measures if necessary, while remaining beyond the range of standard detection systems.

"Any word from Kai?" Sophia asked, not turning from the viewport.

"Transmission received an hour ago," Selene replied. "He's extracted additional files from the quantum drive. Technical specifications for the original modulation prototypes, plus internal communications documenting early test failures."

"Send them to my terminal." Sophia finally turned from the viewport, moving to the small workstation that had been her primary focus during the journey. "And status update on Mira?"

"Last secure transmission indicated she's made contact with Elian and confirmed the boundary instabilities are worsening. Victor Reeves has accelerated the timeline for the Atlantic installation." Selene's expression grew concerned. "She also indicated her cover may be compromised. Victor suspects something."

Sophia absorbed this with the calm of someone accustomed to setbacks. "Has she told Elian about me?"

"Not confirmed. The transmission was brief to avoid detection."

Sophia nodded, her thoughts turning to the son she hadn't seen in twenty years. The boy she'd left behind had become a man who, according to Mira's reports, had been investigating his father's climate crimes independently. Pride mingled with regret—pride in the ethical path he'd chosen, regret for the years of separation her mission had required.

"Prepare the communication system for potential direct contact," she instructed. "If Mira establishes a secure channel with Elian, I want to be ready."

"That's risky," Selene cautioned. "Even with encryption, a direct transmission could be detected."

"Some risks are necessary." Sophia's tone made it clear the decision wasn't open for debate. "Twenty years, Selene. He deserves to hear my voice before we proceed."

Selene nodded, understanding the personal stakes involved. "I'll prepare the system. Minimal transmission duration, maximum encryption."

As Selene worked, Sophia returned her attention to the data Kai had extracted from the quantum drive. The technical specifications confirmed what she had known for decades—the fundamental approach of Project Watershed was flawed, creating boundary instabilities that grew worse over time rather than stabilizing as Haven claimed.

More damning were the internal communications—messages between Victor and Haven's board of directors acknowledging the risks but proceeding anyway. The control over weather patterns that Project Watershed promised was too valuable to abandon, regardless of potential environmental consequences.

What they still lacked was proof that Victor had continued to suppress this information in the current implementation. That evidence could only come from within the station itself—from Victor's private records of executive decisions regarding Project Watershed's expansion.

Evidence that Mira and Elian would attempt to obtain during Victor's absence.

Sophia closed the files, a familiar tension settling between her shoulders. After twenty years of gathering evidence, building networks, and preparing for this confrontation, everything depended on the next forty-eight hours. If they succeeded, Project Watershed would be exposed as the environmental threat she had always known it to be. If they failed, Victor would eliminate the opposition and proceed with global implementation, triggering weather pattern collapse that would dwarf the original Deluge.

And somewhere in that station was her son, who believed she had died twenty years ago.

"Sophia." Selene's voice interrupted her thoughts. "We're picking up increased communication activity from the station. Security protocols are being elevated."

"Victor preparing for his departure?"

"Possibly. Or responding to suspicions about Mira." Selene frowned at her display. "There's also increased power allocation to the modulation systems. They appear to be running some kind of intensive diagnostic."

Sophia moved to Selene's console, studying the readings. "That's not a standard diagnostic. They're pushing the system to maximum capacity, testing boundary resilience."

"Why now? If Victor is concerned about instabilities—"

"He's not testing for instabilities," Sophia interrupted, understanding dawning. "He's testing the system's capacity for intentional weather manipulation. Creating controlled boundary disruptions to generate specific weather patterns."

The realization sent a chill through her. "This was always the end goal. Not just stabilizing weather patterns, but controlling them. Weaponizing them."

"That's speculation," Selene cautioned.

"It's the logical conclusion," Sophia countered. "Control ocean currents, control weather. Control weather, control what remains of the world's habitable regions. Haven's ultimate power play."

Before Selene could respond, an alert sounded from the communication system. "Incoming transmission on secure channel," she reported, surprise evident in her voice. "Origin within the station. Encryption signature matches Mira's device."

"Accept transmission," Sophia ordered, moving quickly to the communication console. "Maximum security protocols."

The system activated, audio only to minimize data transfer. For a moment, there was only static, then a voice—male, with the measured cadence of someone choosing words carefully.

"This is Elian Reeves. I'm told this channel reaches Sophia Reeves. My mother."

Sophia froze, her hand hovering over the response control. Despite her preparation for this moment, the reality of hearing her son's voice after twenty years struck her with unexpected force.

"Sophia?" Selene prompted quietly.

With a deep breath, Sophia activated the response. "This is Sophia. Hello, Elian."

A pause, then: "I need confirmation. Something only my mother would know."

Smart, Sophia thought. Cautious, even in this moment. "On your tenth birthday, you asked for a microscope. Instead, I took you to the tidal pools at Mendocino. You found a rare species of nudibranch and insisted on naming it 'Sparkletoes' because of its iridescent appendages."

Another pause, longer this time. When Elian spoke again, his voice had changed, emotion breaking through the careful control. "It really is you."

"Yes." Sophia's own voice wavered slightly. "I'm sorry, Elian. For letting you believe I was dead. For the years we lost."

"Why?" The single word carried decades of questions.

"Your father was going to implement Project Watershed despite the catastrophic risks I'd documented. When I threatened to go public, he made it clear I wouldn't live to follow through." Sophia's voice hardened with the memory. "Disappearing was the only way to continue fighting while keeping you safe."

"You could have taken me with you," Elian said, the hurt evident despite the distortion of the secure channel.

"You were fourteen, in Haven education, constantly monitored. Extracting you would have exposed the entire network." Sophia closed her eyes briefly. "And I hoped... I hoped you would be safer with your father's resources than on the run with me."

"While I believed my mother was dead." The accusation was quiet but clear.

"Yes." Sophia didn't attempt to justify the choice. "It's a debt I can never repay, Elian. But perhaps we can prevent history from repeating itself. Stop your father from causing another climate catastrophe."

The tactical shift seemed to help Elian refocus. "Mira says you have evidence from the Sofia Institute proving the fundamental flaws in the modulation technology."

"Yes. And Kai has extracted additional files from our quantum drive—internal communications acknowledging the risks but proceeding anyway." Sophia leaned closer to the communication system. "But we need current operational data and executive decisions to create an irrefutable case."

"We're working on that," Elian replied. "My father leaves for Celestia Haven tomorrow. We'll access his private terminal during his absence."

"Be careful," Sophia warned. "If he suspects Mira's true identity, he may have set traps."

"We have a plan." Elian paused, then added, "After this is over... I want to see you. In person."

The request caught Sophia off guard, emotion welling up unexpectedly. "Yes," she managed. "I want that too."

"Transmission duration threshold approaching," Selene warned quietly.

"We need to end this communication," Sophia said reluctantly. "The longer we transmit, the greater the risk of detection."

"I understand," Elian replied. "One more thing. The modulation system is running an unusual diagnostic. Maximum power to boundary testing."

Sophia exchanged a glance with Selene. "As we suspected. Victor is testing the system's capacity for intentional weather manipulation."

"Weaponization," Elian concluded, confirming he'd reached the same conclusion independently. "All the more reason to stop the Atlantic installation."

"Be careful," Sophia repeated. "Your father will eliminate any threat to Project Watershed. Even his own son."

"I know who he is," Elian replied, a new hardness in his voice. "I've been gathering evidence against him for years."

Pride surged through Sophia despite the circumstances. "Then we'll finish this together. Transmission ending now."

As the communication system deactivated, Sophia remained at the console, her hand resting on the controls. Twenty years of separation, condensed into a brief, encrypted exchange. Not the reunion she had imagined during her years in hiding, but perhaps the beginning of one.

"He sounds like you," Selene observed quietly. "The same determination."

"Let's hope he has better luck against Victor than I did," Sophia replied, turning back to the viewport. Somewhere beyond the darkness, the station loomed—and with it, the culmination of her life's work.

The next forty-eight hours would determine whether that work ended in victory or catastrophe.

---

Victor Reeves stood in his private quarters, reviewing final preparations for his departure to Celestia Haven. The holographic display showed security protocols, travel arrangements, and most importantly, the accelerated timeline for the Atlantic installation.

Everything was proceeding according to plan, despite the unexpected complications introduced by Dr. Voss and his son's increasingly problematic environmental concerns. The boundary testing had confirmed what his engineers had long suspected—with sufficient power and precise calibration, the modulation technology could generate specific weather patterns, not merely stabilize existing ones.

The implications were exactly as he had envisioned decades ago, when he first recognized the potential in Sophia's research. Control of ocean currents meant control of weather. Control of weather meant control of what remained of the world.

A chime announced Chief Larson's arrival. Victor deactivated the sensitive displays before admitting him.

"Security preparations are complete, sir," Larson reported. "Your transport departs at 0600 tomorrow. I've implemented the enhanced surveillance protocols as requested."

"And Dr. Voss?"

"Under continuous monitoring. All communications, all movements." Larson handed him a data tablet. "Background investigation has yielded additional information. She appears to be connected to a network operating out of Tidefall—former climate scientists, Tide Callers, coastal region survivors."

Victor reviewed the information with interest. "Any connection to the Sofia Institute?"

"Nothing confirmed. But the timing of their activities suggests possible access to Sofia Institute research." Larson hesitated. "There's one other matter, sir. Director Reeves has been accessing restricted environmental data beyond his clearance level."

This wasn't entirely surprising, but the confirmation deepened Victor's frown. "Through his own credentials?"

"No, sir. Through system vulnerabilities that should have been addressed in the last security update." Larson's expression remained professional, but concern showed in his eyes. "The pattern suggests deliberate circumvention of security protocols."

Victor absorbed this, pieces connecting in his mind. His son's environmental concerns, his interest in Dr. Voss, his questions about New Valencia over the years. Not merely idealistic opposition to Project Watershed, but something more coordinated.

"Has he made contact with any known resistance groups?"

"Not that we've detected. But our surveillance of his private communications has been... limited. He appears to have implemented personal security measures beyond standard Haven protocols."

Another piece of the puzzle. Elian had been more deliberate in his opposition than Victor had realized.

"Implement full surveillance on Director Reeves during my absence," Victor ordered. "All communications, all movements. If he attempts to access restricted systems or makes contact with Dr. Voss outside official channels, I want to know immediately."

"Yes, sir." Larson hesitated. "And if we confirm collaboration with external threats?"

Victor's expression hardened. "Then you will contain the situation, Chief Larson. By whatever means necessary."

"Sir, Director Reeves is your son—"

"Director Reeves is a Haven executive with access to critical systems," Victor interrupted coldly. "If he has chosen to collaborate with forces opposing Project Watershed, he represents a security threat that must be addressed. Is that understood?"

Larson straightened. "Understood, sir."

After Larson departed, Victor returned to the viewport, staring into the darkness of the deep Pacific. Twenty years of work had brought Project Watershed to this critical juncture. The Atlantic installation would create the network effects necessary for true weather control. Nothing would be permitted to interfere—not external consultants with hidden agendas, not resistance groups clinging to outdated notions of climate justice.

Not even his own son, if it came to that.

Victor touched the cold glass, feeling the pressure of the ocean beyond. Humanity had failed to master nature before the Deluge. He would not allow that failure to repeat itself. Whatever the cost, Project Watershed would proceed as planned.

Even if it meant confronting the ghosts of his past one final time.
