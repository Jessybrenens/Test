# Chapter 16: Discoveries Beneath

Six months after the Global Adaptation Summit, Mira descended through layers of increasingly cold water, the specialized diving suit maintaining her body temperature as she followed the soft blue glow of Leila's Tide Caller abilities ahead of her. They were exploring the submerged ruins of an old coastal research facility, one of many sites identified in the data recovered from Haven's archives.

"The main laboratory should be two levels down," Mira's voice transmitted through the water-adapted communication system. "According to the schematics, there was a specialized marine biology wing that might have survived the flooding."

Leila nodded, her movements fluid and precise in the water. In the months since receiving Mira's pendant, her abilities had developed remarkably. She could now manipulate water currents with enough precision to clear sediment from delicate artifacts without disturbing them, a skill proving invaluable for these recovery missions.

"I'm sensing a large enclosed space ahead," Leila replied, her eyes closed in concentration as she extended her awareness through the water. "The structure feels mostly intact, though there's a breach in the eastern section."

They swam through what had once been a grand entrance hall, now a cathedral of algae-draped columns and coral-encrusted information desks. Schools of fish darted away from their lights, disappearing into the shadows of offices that once bustled with researchers and administrators.

Mira consulted the digital map projected inside her diving mask. The Voss Institute had compiled these maps from fragmented pre-Deluge records, Haven's classified archives, and the collective memories of survivors. Each expedition added more detail, slowly reconstructing knowledge that had been lost or deliberately buried.

"This way," she directed, swimming toward a stairwell that descended deeper into the facility. "The specialized containment labs would have been built to withstand extreme conditions. If any research survived intact, it would be there."

As they descended, the ambient light faded completely, leaving only their equipment illuminating the way. The stairwell opened into a wide corridor lined with heavy doors, most still sealed despite decades underwater.

"Remarkable preservation," Mira noted, examining the nearest door. "This facility must have been retrofitted during the early Deluge years, before it was abandoned."

"Or before it was deliberately flooded," Leila added, her voice carrying the edge that often emerged when discussing Haven's past actions. Though too young to remember New Valencia, she had grown up in a settlement that suffered similar fate.

Mira didn't contradict her. The evidence recovered from Haven's archives had revealed patterns of strategic abandonment—facilities and communities sacrificed not just to rising waters but to calculated decisions about resource allocation and information control.

They reached a set of double doors marked "Marine Genomics and Adaptation Research." The electronic locks had long since failed, but the mechanical backup system remained engaged. Mira attached a small device to the manual override, and after a series of clicks, the doors released with a rush of trapped air bubbles.

Inside, the laboratory stood in eerie preservation. Equipment covered in fine silt lined the walls, and specimen containers stood in neat rows on shelves. Unlike the chaotic abandonment seen in many submerged facilities, this one showed signs of methodical shutdown—or evacuation.

"They knew the flooding was coming," Mira observed, examining a logbook protected in a waterproof case. "These final entries describe transferring key research to Haven facilities."

"Not all of it, apparently," Leila replied, carefully clearing sediment from a sealed storage unit with gentle water currents. "This containment system is still active. It's drawing power from somewhere."

Mira swam over, her interest piqued. The unit's status lights glowed faintly green through years of accumulated grime. She wiped the control panel clean, revealing a Haven security classification that made her pulse quicken.

"This is a Class-5 biological containment unit," she said, examining the faded markings. "The highest security level for genetic research during the early Deluge period."

"Can we access it?" Leila asked, already working to clear more of the surrounding area.

"Not here," Mira decided after examining the unit's systems. "It's designed to maintain sample integrity even during transport. We should take it back to the Institute for proper analysis."

They carefully disconnected the unit from its moorings, Mira's oceanographic training guiding them through the process of preserving the delicate power systems. Whatever was inside had been kept in stasis for decades—worth protecting even as the facility was abandoned to the rising waters.

As they secured the unit for transport, a subtle vibration passed through the water. Leila froze, her eyes closing as she extended her Tide Caller senses.

"Something's changing in the current patterns," she said, her voice tense. "Not natural movement."

Mira checked her equipment readings. "No seismic activity registered. Could it be structural settlement in the building?"

"No," Leila replied with certainty. "It's mechanical. Something large, moving through the water about half a kilometer east of us."

They exchanged glances, both thinking the same thing. Since the summit, most Haven vessels respected the new cooperative protocols, but some factions within Haven remained resistant to the changes. Rogue operations had been detected several times, particularly near sites with valuable pre-Deluge research.

"Let's move quickly," Mira decided, securing the containment unit to her equipment harness. "We'll take the western exit route."

They navigated through the laboratory complex with practiced efficiency, Leila using her abilities to clear debris from their path while Mira consulted their digital map for the fastest route to the surface. The vibrations grew more pronounced as they moved, suggesting whatever was approaching had detected their presence.

They emerged from the facility into open water just as a sleek submersible came into view, its design unmistakably Haven military—not the collaborative research vessels now common in these waters. Its forward lights swept across the ruins, methodically searching.

"Stay close to the structure," Mira instructed, pulling Leila into the shadow of what had once been a cooling tower. "Their sensors are designed for open water detection, not complex environments like this."

They watched as the submersible hovered near the facility's main entrance, extending mechanical arms to clear debris. It was clearly searching for something specific—perhaps the same containment unit now secured to Mira's harness.

"We need to contact Tidefall," Leila whispered, though the communication system made whispering unnecessary. "If Haven military is operating here without authorization, the Council should know."

"Agreed, but not from here," Mira replied. "Any transmission would give away our position. We need to reach the rendezvous point first."

They waited until the submersible disappeared into the facility, then began moving carefully through the ruins, using the complex architecture to mask their movement. Leila created subtle currents to disperse their trail, a technique she had developed for evading predators during deep-water training.

The rendezvous point was three kilometers away—a small research vessel disguised as a fishing boat, crewed by a mixed team from the Voss Institute. As they swam, Mira's mind raced with questions about the containment unit and the Haven submersible. The timing couldn't be coincidence; somehow, Haven had learned about this facility and its contents just as the Voss Institute had.

"There's our extraction point," Mira said as the boat's anchor chain came into view. "Let's—"

Her words cut off as Leila suddenly grabbed her arm, pulling her behind an outcropping of coral-encrusted concrete. A moment later, a second Haven vessel passed overhead, this one smaller and faster than the submersible they'd seen earlier.

"Patrol craft," Mira identified, recognizing the design from her time infiltrating Haven. "They're establishing a perimeter."

Leila's expression hardened behind her diving mask. "They really want whatever's in this containment unit."

"Which means we definitely need to get it back to the Institute," Mira replied. "Can you create a distraction?"

Leila nodded, her confidence evident despite the danger. "Give me a moment to prepare."

She closed her eyes, extending her awareness deep into the surrounding water. Mira watched as the familiar blue glow intensified around Leila's hands, spreading outward in complex patterns that reminded her of the memorial ceremony months earlier. The young Tide Caller had grown remarkably in both skill and power.

"Ready," Leila said, opening her eyes. "When I release this pattern, it will create a series of current anomalies about a kilometer north of here. Their sensors will register it as multiple objects moving erratically."

"Perfect. On my mark..." Mira watched the patrol craft's movement, waiting for the optimal moment. "Now!"

Leila released her constructed pattern, and immediately the water north of their position began to churn in unnatural ways. The patrol craft's lights swiveled toward the disturbance, and after a moment's hesitation, it accelerated in that direction.

"Go!" Mira urged, and they swam rapidly toward the extraction vessel, no longer concerned with stealth.

They surfaced alongside the boat, where hands immediately reached down to help them aboard. As Mira climbed onto the deck, she saw Kai at the helm, his expression shifting from concern to relief.

"We were about to send a search team," he said, helping her remove the diving equipment. "Haven vessels have been circling this area for the past hour."

"They're looking for this," Mira replied, carefully handing over the containment unit. "Class-5 biological research, still active after all these years."

Kai's eyebrows rose as he examined the unit. "Must be something significant if they're deploying military assets to recover it."

"Which is exactly why we need to get it back to Tidefall immediately," Mira said, helping Leila aboard. "And we need to alert the Council about Haven's unauthorized operation here."

As the boat's engines hummed to life, Mira looked back at the water where bubbles still rose from their ascent. The Haven patrol craft had already realized the distraction for what it was and was turning back toward their position.

"They're coming about," she warned.

"Don't worry," Kai replied with a grim smile, engaging the vessel's main drive. "This 'simple fishing boat' has a few surprises."

The vessel surged forward with unexpected speed, confirming Mira's suspicions that Kai had modified it with salvaged Haven technology. As they accelerated away from the site, she secured the containment unit in a specialized hold designed for transporting recovered artifacts.

Leila joined her, still catching her breath from the intense use of her abilities. "Do you think they'll pursue us all the way to Tidefall?"

"No," Mira replied, watching the Haven vessel growing smaller behind them. "They won't risk a direct confrontation that could be reported to the joint oversight committee. But they'll definitely report our presence to their command."

"Which means we need to understand what's in this unit before they come up with a diplomatic excuse to claim it," Kai added, joining them after setting the autopilot.

Mira nodded, studying the containment unit's control panel more carefully now that they were safely aboard. The classification markings included a project code she didn't recognize from her time in Haven—something older, perhaps from the early Deluge years when Haven was still establishing its authority.

"Whatever this is," she said, "it was important enough to power for decades in an abandoned facility, and important enough to send military assets to recover. That makes it exactly the kind of thing the Voss Institute needs to understand."

As their vessel cut through the waves toward Tidefall, Mira couldn't shake the feeling that they had stumbled onto something significant—not just valuable research, but potentially another piece of Haven's buried history. The summit had exposed many of Haven's climate crimes, but decades of secrets remained hidden in facilities like the one they'd just explored.

The containment unit hummed softly beside her, its contents a mystery that might connect to her parents' work, to New Valencia, to the fundamental questions about adaptation that drove the Institute's mission. Whatever answers it held, Mira was determined to bring them into the light—just as she had done with Haven's other secrets.

Leila placed a hand on the unit, her Tide Caller senses extending into it. "There's water inside," she said with surprise. "Specialized water, different from the ocean. I can feel it... waiting."

Mira met her gaze, intrigued by this unexpected insight. "Then let's not keep it waiting any longer."
