# Chapter 9: The Confession

Elian's private office occupied a small section of the administrative level, its design more functional than the luxurious spaces typically reserved for Haven executives. A desk fabricated from recycled materials dominated one side, while the opposite wall featured a viewport offering a different perspective of the ocean than the observation deck—deeper, darker, the pressure more evident in the way light behaved at this depth.

Mira entered cautiously, scanning for exits and potential threats. The room contained standard office equipment, a small seating area, and environmental monitoring displays. Nothing overtly dangerous, though the door sliding closed behind them sent a flicker of unease through her chest.

Elian moved to his desk and activated a small device embedded in its surface. A subtle hum filled the room, barely perceptible but unmistakable to Mira's heightened senses.

"Signal dampening field," he explained. "Blocks all standard surveillance. My father believes it's for conducting sensitive corporate business. In reality..." He gestured toward a hidden panel that slid open to reveal a separate terminal. "I've been conducting my own investigation for years."

Mira maintained her distance, positioning herself where she could watch both Elian and the door. "You said you have evidence about New Valencia."

"I do." Elian studied her, his expression a complex mixture of caution and what might have been hope. "But first, I need to know who I'm really talking to. Are you Mira Voss, daughter of Elena and David Voss?"

The moment stretched between them, a decision point with no safe path forward. Mira touched her pendant, feeling the water respond to her tension. Partial truth might be her only viable option.

"Yes," she admitted finally. "My parents died at New Valencia."

"During the evacuation failure." Elian's voice softened slightly. "Which wasn't a failure at all, but a deliberate action authorized by my father."

Mira's pulse quickened. "You know this for certain?"

"I've been piecing it together for years." Elian activated the hidden terminal, displaying a series of documents. "Internal memos, security directives, compensation records for personnel involved. Not enough for legal action—Haven controls the courts—but enough to confirm what happened."

The screen showed fragments of the same evidence Mira had just discovered in the archives, along with additional materials she hadn't accessed. Elian Reeves had been conducting his own investigation parallel to hers, accumulating proof of his father's crimes.

"Why?" Mira asked, the question encompassing more than she could articulate. Why would Victor Reeves's son gather evidence against him? Why reveal this to her now? Why risk everything for the truth?

Elian's gaze shifted to the viewport, to the darkness beyond. "My mother was a climate scientist. Sophia Reeves, founder of the Sofia Institute."

"I know who she was," Mira said carefully, watching his reaction.

"She died when I was fourteen. At least, that's what my father told me." Bitterness edged his voice. "A research vessel lost during a storm. No survivors, no bodies recovered. I accepted it for years, until I found inconsistencies in the official reports."

Mira remained silent, letting him continue. This was information Sophia hadn't shared—how her son had begun questioning the narrative of her death.

"I started looking into other 'accidents' involving climate researchers. New Valencia was the largest, but not the only one." Elian turned back to her. "Your parents were attempting to evacuate with research proving corporate responsibility for climate acceleration. Research that would have implicated Oceanic Solutions and other Haven corporations in crimes against humanity."

"And your father couldn't allow that," Mira said, the familiar cold anger settling in her chest.

"No. He authorized Operation Containment. Disabled the evacuation vessels' navigation systems, ensuring they couldn't leave the harbor before the sea wall failed." Elian's voice remained steady, but his hands had clenched at his sides. "Four thousand people sacrificed to protect corporate interests."

Mira studied him, searching for any sign of deception. "Why tell me this? Why risk exposing your own investigation?"

"Because you're here for the same reason I am." Elian met her gaze directly. "To find evidence linking my father to climate crimes and expose the truth about Project Watershed."

The statement hung between them, a bridge across the gulf of suspicion. Mira weighed her options carefully. Complete honesty would mean revealing Sophia's survival—a disclosure that wasn't hers to make. But continuing to hide her true purpose would squander a potential alliance they might desperately need.

"I came to find evidence about New Valencia," she acknowledged. "And to investigate Project Watershed's environmental impact."

"But not as an oceanographic consultant." Elian's tone made it a statement rather than a question.

"No." Mira straightened slightly. "Though my knowledge in that area is genuine."

"And you're a Tide Caller." Again, not a question.

Mira tensed, her hand moving instinctively toward her pendant. "What makes you say that?"

"The water responds to you differently than to others. Subtle changes in pressure and flow when you pass through certain areas of the station. Nothing obvious enough to trigger the standard detection systems, but noticeable to someone who's been studying Tide Caller phenomena."

His observation skills were sharper than she'd anticipated. "And yet you haven't reported me to security."

"I have no interest in supporting Haven's persecution of Tide Callers." Elian's expression hardened. "Another of my father's policies I disagree with."

Mira made a decision. Not complete disclosure, but enough truth to establish a working trust. "I'm part of a network investigating Haven's climate crimes and the potential dangers of Project Watershed. We have reason to believe the modulation technology is fundamentally flawed and could trigger catastrophic weather patterns if implemented globally."

"The boundary instabilities," Elian nodded. "They're worse than the official reports indicate. I've been falsifying data to buy time, but my father is accelerating the timeline for the Atlantic installation."

This was new information. "How soon?"

"Construction begins in three weeks. Once the second station comes online, the network effects will amplify any instabilities in the system." Elian's expression grew grim. "We could see hyperstorm formation within months, not years as I originally calculated."

Mira absorbed this, recalculating timelines. Sophia's plan had assumed a longer window before the Atlantic installation became operational. "We need to stop it before construction begins."

"'We'?" Elian raised an eyebrow. "Who exactly are you working with, Mira?"

She hesitated, then offered a partial truth. "People who remember what the corporations did. Scientists, engineers, survivors from coastal regions. We've been gathering evidence for years."

"And now you need access to Project Watershed's core systems to prove the technology is flawed." Elian studied her with new intensity. "That's why you accepted my invitation to consult."

"Yes."

"What were you planning to do with the evidence once you had it?"

"Broadcast it throughout Haven and to remaining land governments. Force accountability for past crimes and prevent future catastrophe." Mira watched his reaction carefully. "Your father and the other Haven executives would face justice for their actions."

Elian absorbed this without visible emotion, though something flickered in his eyes—not surprise or outrage, but what might have been resignation. "And what would happen to Project Watershed?"

"Dismantled. The technology is too dangerous to exist, even with modifications."

He nodded slowly. "I've reached the same conclusion. The fundamental approach is flawed—trying to control natural systems rather than working with them." He gestured toward the terminal. "I've been developing an alternative approach based on distributed, smaller-scale interventions that support rather than override ocean current patterns."

Mira hadn't expected this level of alignment with their goals. "You'd help expose your own father? Destroy his legacy project?"

"My father destroyed his own legacy when he chose corporate profit over human lives." Elian's voice carried quiet conviction. "I've spent years trying to moderate his worst impulses from within the system. It hasn't worked. The time for half measures is past."

The declaration seemed genuine, but Mira maintained her caution. "Why should I trust you?"

"You shouldn't, necessarily." A hint of wry humor touched his expression. "Just as I shouldn't trust someone who infiltrated this facility under false pretenses. But we appear to share common goals, and neither of us can achieve them alone."

He had a point. Mira needed access to systems that required his clearance level. And if his father truly was accelerating the timeline for expansion, they faced a more urgent deadline than Sophia had anticipated.

"What exactly are you proposing?" she asked.

"An alliance. I provide you access to the core systems and evidence about New Valencia. You share whatever you find with your network." Elian's gaze was steady. "Together, we expose the truth and prevent the Atlantic installation from proceeding."

It was essentially what Sophia had hoped for—Elian joining their effort willingly. But Mira still hesitated, aware of the complexities involved. "Your father will be implicated directly. He'll likely face criminal charges if we succeed."

"I know." Something like grief passed across Elian's features before his expression settled into resolve. "I made my peace with that possibility years ago, when I first found evidence of his involvement in New Valencia."

Mira studied him, searching for any sign of deception or hidden agenda. She found only determination and what appeared to be genuine ethical conviction. Either Elian Reeves was sincere in his opposition to his father's actions, or he was an exceptionally skilled actor.

"Alright," she said finally. "A provisional alliance. But I maintain contact with my network, and I make no promises about what happens to your father when this is over."

"Agreed." Elian extended his hand. "Though we should establish some ground rules for operational security."

Mira accepted the handshake, noting the firmness of his grip and the calluses that suggested he worked with his hands more than most Haven executives. "Such as?"

"No unauthorized system access. I can provide what you need without triggering security protocols." He released her hand. "And we should maintain our public roles—consultant and project director—to avoid suspicion."

"Reasonable," Mira agreed. "And we should limit direct meetings. Your father is already watching me."

"Yes, the security update was almost certainly aimed at you." Elian moved to the terminal, pulling up a station schematic. "We can use maintenance access point 17-B for exchanges if necessary. It's in a blind spot between surveillance zones."

His familiarity with the station's security vulnerabilities suggested this wasn't his first time operating outside official channels. "You've done this before," Mira observed.

A ghost of a smile touched his lips. "Let's just say I've had practice navigating around my father's surveillance systems."

The conversation was interrupted by a priority alert on Elian's official communication device. He checked it, his expression darkening.

"My father has called an emergency project review for 0800 tomorrow. All senior staff and consultants required to attend." He looked up at Mira. "He's going to announce the accelerated timeline for the Atlantic installation."

"Can you delay it?"

"Not without revealing my concerns about the boundary instabilities, which would only increase his suspicion." Elian's mind was clearly racing through options. "But this gives us an opportunity. While everyone is focused on the project review, we could access the core systems and extract the raw data on the instabilities."

Mira considered this. "We'd need a distraction to draw attention away from the system access."

"I can arrange that." Elian's expression shifted to something more determined. "There's a scheduled maintenance procedure for the external sensor array tomorrow. I can modify the parameters to trigger a minor alert—nothing dangerous, but enough to divert security attention."

The plan was taking shape, but Mira still had reservations. "What about your father? He'll be watching both of us."

"My father will be focused on the project review and the Atlantic timeline. As long as we maintain our expected roles during the meeting, his attention will be on his announcement, not us." Elian's confidence was either well-founded or dangerously naive. "After the review, I can escort you to the environmental monitoring lab as a logical follow-up to your consultation. From there, we can access the core system data."

Mira weighed the risks against the opportunity. If they succeeded, they would have concrete evidence of Project Watershed's fatal flaws—evidence that could prevent the Atlantic installation and expose Victor Reeves's climate crimes. If they failed, they would likely both face Haven security, with consequences she preferred not to contemplate.

"Alright," she agreed finally. "But we need a contingency plan if something goes wrong."

"I've prepared for that possibility." Elian accessed a secure drawer in his desk, retrieving a small device. "This contains emergency protocols that will grant you access to an escape vessel if necessary. It's registered to my biometrics, but I can transfer authorization."

The level of preparation surprised her. "You've been planning this for some time."

"Years," Elian admitted. "Waiting for the right moment, the right leverage." His eyes met hers. "The right ally."

The word hung between them, laden with implications neither was prepared to address. Mira redirected to practical matters. "I should return to my quarters before my absence raises questions. We'll proceed as discussed tomorrow."

Elian nodded, deactivating the signal dampening field. "One more thing, Mira." His voice had softened slightly. "Whatever happens tomorrow, know that I'm committed to stopping Project Watershed and exposing the truth about New Valencia. Not just for scientific reasons, but because it's the right thing to do."

The sincerity in his voice caught her off guard. For years, she had viewed all Haven leadership as the enemy—particularly anyone named Reeves. Elian was forcing her to reconsider that simplistic division.

"I believe you," she said, surprising herself with the realization that she meant it.

As she left his office, Mira felt the weight of their alliance settling across her shoulders. She had come seeking vengeance against Victor Reeves and found an unexpected ally in his son. The mission had evolved beyond her original parameters, becoming something more complex than simple revenge.

The pendant warmed against her skin as she navigated back to her quarters, avoiding security patrols with the heightened awareness that came with her Tide Caller abilities. Tomorrow would bring either a critical breakthrough or catastrophic failure. Either way, there would be no returning to the careful plans she had made before arriving at the station.

Victor Reeves stood in the modulation station's command center, surrounded by displays showing the system's operational metrics. Engineers and technicians worked at their stations, their movements precise and efficient under his watchful eye.

"Dr. Chen," he addressed the lead systems engineer. "Prepare for a full diagnostic of the integration protocols. I want to ensure seamless connection capability when we bring the Atlantic installation online."

"Sir?" Dr. Chen's surprise was evident. "The integration testing wasn't scheduled until after the Atlantic station completed initial calibration."

"The schedule has changed." Victor's tone brooked no argument. "Construction begins in three weeks. I want this station fully prepared for immediate network integration once the Atlantic facility comes online."

The command center staff exchanged glances, but no one voiced the concerns evident in their expressions. Victor had selected them for technical expertise combined with appropriate respect for authority. They would follow orders, whatever their private reservations.

"There's one other matter," Victor continued. "Our external consultant, Dr. Voss, will be joining tomorrow's project review. I want her access limited to the environmental data prepared by Dr. Nakamura. Nothing related to the core systems or network integration plans."

"Yes, sir." Dr. Chen made a note on his tablet. "Should we inform Director Reeves of these restrictions?"

Victor's expression hardened slightly at the mention of his son. "I'll handle communication with the Director. Just ensure the technical limitations are in place."

After issuing additional instructions for the system diagnostic, Victor left the command center and made his way to his private quarters. Unlike the functional spaces occupied by most station personnel, his suite featured luxurious appointments befitting his status—imported materials, custom furnishings, and a viewport specially designed to optimize the view of the ocean beyond.

Once inside, he activated his secure communication system, bypassing the station's standard channels to connect directly with Haven security headquarters in Celestia Haven.

"Director Mercer," he said when the connection established. "Status update on our consultant."

"Surveillance is in place, Mr. Reeves." Mercer's voice carried the precision of a career security officer. "Dr. Voss has remained primarily in her quarters reviewing the environmental data, with one notable exception—a meeting with your son on Observation Deck 3 earlier today."

"Content of their discussion?"

"Unknown. The deck's ambient noise dampening prevented clear audio capture. Body language suggested a professional but engaged conversation."

Victor frowned. Elian's interest in the consultant had seemed professional on the surface—seeking external validation for his environmental concerns. But Victor had learned to trust his instincts where potential threats were concerned.

"And her background investigation?"

"Ongoing. The New Valencia connection is confirmed—Elena and David Voss were her parents. We've also identified gaps in her documented history between the evacuation failure and her emergence at Tidefall University. Not unusual for Deluge survivors, but potentially significant given her current position."

"Any connection to known resistance groups?"

A pause. "Nothing confirmed. However, there has been increased communication activity from a node in Tidefall that our analysts have previously flagged as suspicious. Possible correlation with her deployment to the station."

Victor absorbed this, pieces connecting in his mind. If Marina Voss was actually Mira Voss, seeking revenge for her parents' deaths at New Valencia, she might well have allied with one of the anti-Haven groups operating in the margins of the post-flood world. The timing of her consultation, just as Project Watershed prepared for global expansion, suggested more than coincidence.

"Implement full surveillance protocol," Victor ordered. "All communications, all movements. I want to know who she's working with and what she's really after."

"Already in progress, sir. And if we confirm she's a security threat?"

Victor's expression hardened. "Then we contain the threat, Director Mercer. Permanently if necessary."

After ending the transmission, Victor moved to the viewport, staring into the ocean darkness. Project Watershed represented the culmination of his life's work—technology that would cement Haven control over what remained of the world's habitable regions. Control of ocean currents meant control of weather patterns. Control of weather meant control of food production, water access, survival itself.

He had sacrificed too much to allow interference now. Not from external consultants with hidden agendas. Not from resistance groups clinging to outdated notions of climate justice. Not even from his own son, whose environmental concerns had become increasingly problematic.

The ocean pressed against the viewport glass, vast and dark. Somewhere in that darkness lay the future Victor had engineered through decades of calculated decisions. The weak had been sacrificed so the strong could survive. The past had been buried so the future could be controlled.

And he would ensure it remained that way, no matter the cost.

Victor's reflection stared back at him from the viewport—silver-haired, commanding, absolute in his conviction. Behind him, the station's systems hummed with the power to reshape the world. Before him stretched the ocean, waiting to be mastered.

The Atlantic installation would be built. The network would be completed. And Haven would secure its dominance for generations to come.

Even if it meant confronting the ghosts of New Valencia one final time.
