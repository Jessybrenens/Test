# Chapter 1: The Salvager

The water remembered what people forgot.

Mira Voss felt its currents against her skin as she descended through the murky green depths. Fifty meters down, the pressure squeezed her wetsuit against her body, a familiar embrace that most would find suffocating. For her, it was a homecoming.

She adjusted the small propulsion unit strapped to her left thigh, its quiet hum vibrating through her bones. The modified Haven tech had cost her three months of salvage, but it extended her range and saved precious oxygen. Worth every credit.

Ahead, the skeletal remains of Old San Francisco's financial district emerged from the gloom. Skyscrapers, once monuments to human ambition, now served as artificial reefs. Marine life had claimed these towers, transforming glass and steel into living cathedrals of coral and algae.

Mira checked her wrist display. Oxygen: 67%. Time: 14:23. Location: Grid sector 8-F. The Haven security drone patrol wouldn't sweep this area for another forty minutes. Plenty of time.

She navigated toward a partially collapsed building, its corporate logo long eroded by saltwater and time. According to her research, this had been the headquarters of a tech company that specialized in data storage. If she was lucky, their server room would still contain salvageable components. Pre-flood tech fetched premium prices from Haven collectors and researchers alike.

As she approached the building's shattered lobby, Mira felt the water shift. Not a natural current. Something large was moving nearby.

She killed her propulsion unit and pressed herself against the algae-covered wall, becoming still as stone. Through the green haze, a Haven security drone glided past—a sleek, torpedo-shaped machine with scanning arrays where a nose should be. It moved with predatory precision, its sensors sweeping methodically through the ruins.

Mira closed her eyes and reached out with her other sense—the one she kept hidden from the world above. The water spoke to her in pressure and temperature, in subtle movements and microscopic changes. She felt the drone's path through the disturbance it created, tracking its progress without needing to see it.

The drone was off-schedule. Someone had changed the patrol patterns without updating the public logs. Sloppy security or deliberate trap? Either way, she needed to adapt.

Mira focused on the water surrounding her, feeling its molecules respond to her will. The temperature around her body dropped by two degrees—not enough to harm her in her insulated wetsuit, but enough to mask her thermal signature from the drone's sensors. An old trick, but effective.

The drone paused, its sensors pulsing as it hovered twenty meters away. Mira remained motionless, controlling her breathing to minimize bubbles. After what felt like eternity, the drone resumed its patrol, gliding away into the murky distance.

She waited until she could no longer feel its presence before continuing toward her target. The building's interior was a maze of collapsed walls and floating debris. Mira navigated by memory and instinct, having studied old floor plans salvaged from a municipal database.

The server room would be on the third sublevel—now accessible through what had once been an elevator shaft. Mira swam downward, her headlamp cutting through decades of accumulated silt. The beam reflected off something metallic ahead.

The server room door remained intact, its electronic lock long dead. Mira retrieved a compact pry bar from her utility belt and wedged it into the door's seam. With practiced efficiency, she applied leverage until the door groaned open, releasing a cloud of sediment.

She waited for the cloud to settle before entering. The room beyond was a time capsule. Rows of server racks stood like tombstones, their contents protected from the worst of the ocean's corrosion by the room's reinforced design. This was exactly what she'd hoped to find.

Mira moved methodically through the room, examining each rack for salvageable components. Most would be worthless, their circuits long destroyed by saltwater intrusion. But occasionally, sealed units survived—their data intact, their processing cores still viable. Those were worth a small fortune to the right buyers.

Her trained eye spotted a promising candidate—a rack with the distinctive housing of quantum storage drives. These were rare even before the flood, designed to maintain data integrity under extreme conditions. If even one was intact, this dive would pay for itself many times over.

Mira carefully extracted the drive unit, securing it in her reinforced collection bag. As she worked, her fingers brushed against the scale-like birthmarks along her collarbone—a unconscious habit when she was alone. The marks were barely visible beneath her wetsuit, but she knew their pattern by heart. The sign of a Tide Caller, her mother had explained during those final days before the evacuation. A gift and a burden.

A distant boom reverberated through the water, vibrating through Mira's chest. She froze, recognizing the sound of depth charges—Haven security's preferred method for clearing "unauthorized salvagers" from restricted areas. They weren't close enough to threaten her directly, but they signaled increased security activity in the sector.

Time to leave.

Mira secured her collection bag and exited the server room. She took a different route back, staying close to the building's exterior where the coral growth would help mask her movement from any passing drones.

As she ascended toward the surface, the water around her grew warmer and lighter. The crushing pressure eased, but so did the sense of belonging. Mira always felt most herself in the depths, where her abilities flowed naturally and the boundaries between her body and the ocean blurred.

The surface world, with its rigid divisions and constant vigilance, was the real pressure.

Her head broke the surface two kilometers from her entry point, in a secluded cove hidden from Haven surveillance by a quirk of topography. A small boat bobbed nearby, its weathered hull camouflaged with algae and barnacles to blend with the countless pieces of floating debris that dotted the ocean's surface.

Mira pulled herself aboard and removed her breathing apparatus. The afternoon sun warmed her face as she secured her collection bag and started the boat's quiet electric motor. To any passing Haven patrol, she would appear to be just another Drowned scavenger collecting floating garbage—one of thousands who eked out a living from the flooded world's surface.

They wouldn't look closely enough to see the high-tech salvage hidden beneath the decoy layer of plastic waste. They wouldn't notice how the water around her boat moved against the prevailing current, speeding her journey back to Tidefall.

The water remembered what people forgot. And Mira remembered what the corporations wanted everyone to forget—that the flood wasn't an unavoidable tragedy. It was a crime. One she intended to make them pay for, one salvage mission at a time.

As Tidefall appeared on the horizon—its jumble of repurposed structures rising from the water like a mirage—Mira allowed herself a small smile. The quantum drive in her bag might contain more than valuable technology. It might contain evidence. Another piece of the puzzle she'd been assembling for years.

Another step toward finding the people responsible for her parents' death. Another step toward justice.

Or revenge. Sometimes, Mira wasn't sure there was a difference.
