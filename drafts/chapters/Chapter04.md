# Chapter 4: The Gathering

The Haven elite gathered like exotic birds, their clothing a riot of colors and textures that hadn't existed in the world below for decades. Women draped in fabrics engineered to shift hues with body temperature. Men wearing jackets with illuminated seams that pulsed in time with ambient music. Jewelry crafted from materials salvaged from flooded cities—gold and platinum and diamonds, yes, but also circuit boards and fiber optics repurposed as status symbols.

Mira observed it all from behind the mask of Dr. Marina Voss, oceanographic consultant. Her credentials—meticulously forged with Kai's help—identified her as a Tide Dweller specialist hired by the Haven Council's Environmental Assessment Committee. The invitation to this gathering had cost her three months of planning and a significant portion of her savings, but it placed her within arm's reach of her target for the first time.

The Grand Atrium of Celestia Haven's Cultural Center had once been the ballroom of a luxury cruise ship. Salvaged during the Acceleration phase, it now served as the floating city's premier gathering space. Massive windows offered panoramic views of the endless ocean, now turned silver by moonlight. Hovering service drones circulated with trays of food and drink, programmed to recognize guests' status by their access chips.

Mira accepted a flute of champagne from a passing drone, using the motion to scan the room. Security was present but subtle—Haven guards positioned at exits, surveillance systems disguised as decorative elements, and undoubtedly weapons scanners integrated into the entry archways. She'd passed through those scanners with confidence, carrying nothing that would trigger alerts.

Her most dangerous weapon wasn't metal or plastic. It was the water itself, responding to her will in ways Haven security couldn't detect.

"Fascinating choice of accessory," said a voice beside her. "Most consultants opt for something more... conventional."

Mira turned to find a tall man studying the pendant she wore—a small vial containing water, suspended from a simple silver chain. His attire was understated by Haven standards—a well-cut suit in deep blue with only minimal illumination along the cuffs. His features were striking: strong jawline, gray-green eyes that observed with unusual intensity, and a small scar along his left jaw that added character to what might otherwise have been too perfect a face.

She recognized him immediately from her research. Elian Reeves, heir to Oceanic Solutions. Son of her target.

"Convention is overrated," Mira replied, touching the pendant briefly. "This contains water from the Mediterranean Basin—one of the few samples taken before the salinity shift of 2097."

"Pre-Deluge oceanography," Elian said, genuine interest flickering in his eyes. "You're Dr. Voss, correct? The Council mentioned they'd contracted external expertise for the southern reef assessment."

Mira nodded, maintaining the poised demeanor she'd practiced for weeks. "And you're Elian Reeves. Your company's desalination technology is referenced in most of my research papers."

"For better or worse," he said with a self-deprecating smile that didn't quite reach his eyes.

An interesting response. Not the corporate pride she'd expected.

"The technology works," Mira said, watching him carefully. "Though I have questions about the discharge management protocols."

"As do I." Elian glanced around before continuing in a lower voice. "The hypersaline outflow is creating dead zones that our public reports don't acknowledge. I've been pushing for containment systems, but cost-benefit analyses keep delaying implementation."

Mira allowed genuine surprise to show on her face. This wasn't the company line. Either Elian Reeves was testing her, or he was more complicated than her intelligence suggested.

"Cost-benefit analyses have a poor track record with environmental issues," she said. "We calculated the 'acceptable costs' of carbon emissions for a century. Now we live on the ocean instead of beside it."

Something shifted in Elian's expression—a flash of what might have been respect or recognition. Before he could respond, a chime sounded, indicating the formal program would begin.

"It seems we're being summoned to the presentation," he said. "Would you join me, Dr. Voss? I'd appreciate your perspective on what's about to be discussed."

This was unexpected—an opportunity to remain close to a Reeves without having to manufacture a reason. Mira nodded, following Elian toward the central dais where Haven Council members were assembling.

The crowd arranged itself according to the invisible hierarchies that governed Haven society. Council members and corporate executives claimed the front positions. Their direct reports formed a second tier. Various specialists, consultants, and lesser executives—Mira's current disguise—occupied the third ring. Security personnel remained at the perimeter, their enhanced vision allowing them to monitor from a distance.

Victor Reeves stood among the Council members, commanding attention without visible effort. In person, he was more imposing than in the images Mira had studied—tall and straight-backed despite his sixty-three years, with silver hair and the same strong jawline as his son. His eyes, however, were different—cold and calculating where Elian's held complexity.

This was the man responsible for her parents' death. The man who had ordered the destruction of evacuation vessels to protect corporate secrets. The man whose company had suppressed research that might have prevented millions of deaths.

Mira felt a familiar coldness settle in her chest—the emotional distance she'd cultivated over years of planning. She would not allow hatred to cloud her judgment. Not when she was so close.

Councilor Diaz, the current head of the Haven governing body, stepped forward to begin the proceedings. "Distinguished guests, we've gathered to discuss the Environmental Stability Initiative and its implications for our continued prosperity."

The presentation that followed was carefully crafted propaganda. Councilor Diaz outlined Haven achievements in "managing" the post-flood world—desalination systems, floating agricultural platforms, energy generation. Each point was accompanied by holographic visualizations showing Haven benevolence extending to Tide Dweller communities and even select Drowned settlements.

What went unmentioned was the resource extraction, the exploitation of labor, the military enforcement of Haven territorial claims. The presentation portrayed the corporate-controlled Havens as humanity's saviors rather than opportunistic survivors who had climbed to safety on the backs of others.

Mira maintained her professional mask, occasionally nodding at appropriate moments. Beside her, Elian Reeves watched with an expression that revealed nothing—a skill likely inherited from his father.

"Our next phase," Councilor Diaz continued, "involves expanded stability operations in sectors previously considered non-viable. Oceanic Solutions has developed breakthrough technology that will be central to this initiative. Mr. Reeves, would you share an overview?"

Victor Reeves stepped forward with the confidence of someone accustomed to command. "Thank you, Councilor. For decades, we've adapted to the world the flood created. Now, we're preparing to take a more active role in shaping that world."

He activated a holographic display showing ocean current patterns. "Project Watershed represents the culmination of research dating back to pre-flood era. Using targeted energy fields, we can modify deep ocean currents that drive surface conditions."

The display shifted to show a network of underwater installations. "These modulation stations, placed at key points in global current systems, will allow unprecedented control over regional climate patterns. Areas currently uninhabitable due to hyperstorms could be stabilized. Agricultural yields could be increased by optimizing rainfall distribution."

Mira felt her pulse quicken. This aligned with the anomalous current patterns Dr. Reyes had mentioned—but the scale was far greater than she'd imagined. They weren't just testing; they were implementing.

"The first modulation station is already operational in the North Pacific Trench," Victor continued. "Initial results have exceeded projections. With Council approval, we'll begin construction of the Atlantic and Indian Ocean stations within six months."

The implications were staggering. Control of ocean currents meant control of global weather patterns. Control of weather meant control of food production, habitability, survival itself. The Haven corporations, having profited from the climate catastrophe, were now positioning themselves as the arbiters of Earth's remaining viable environments.

"Questions will be addressed at tomorrow's technical briefing," Councilor Diaz announced as Victor concluded. "For now, please enjoy the remainder of the evening."

As the formal presentation ended, the gathering dissolved back into social clusters. Mira turned to Elian, whose expression had grown more guarded during his father's presentation.

"Your father didn't mention the ecological impact assessments," she said, testing his reaction. "Manipulating ocean currents at that scale would have cascading effects on marine ecosystems."

Elian's eyes met hers, and for a moment, Mira glimpsed something unexpected—concern, possibly even alarm, quickly masked.

"The assessments are ongoing," he said carefully. "As Project Director, I've insisted on comprehensive modeling before full implementation."

This was new information. Elian wasn't just the corporate heir; he was directly involved with Project Watershed.

"You're the director?" Mira allowed her professional interest to show. "I'd be very interested in reviewing those models. My work on post-flood marine adaptation might provide useful baseline data."

Before Elian could respond, a security officer approached them. "Mr. Reeves, your father requests your presence."

Elian nodded to the officer before turning back to Mira. "It seems duty calls, Dr. Voss. But I'm intrigued by your offer." He retrieved a small card from his jacket and handed it to her. "My private contact. The project could benefit from external expertise not filtered through corporate protocols."

Mira accepted the card, concealing her surprise. This was an unexpected development—access to Project Watershed's director, offered without prompting.

"I look forward to continuing our discussion," she said.

Elian held her gaze a moment longer than necessary. "As do I. There's more to discuss than can be covered at a gathering like this."

As he walked away, Mira considered the implications. Elian Reeves was either setting a trap—testing a suspicious consultant before reporting her to security—or he was genuinely concerned about his father's project. Either possibility complicated her plans.

She circulated through the gathering for another hour, gathering snippets of conversation about Project Watershed while maintaining her cover. The Haven elite spoke freely around her, assuming that a mere consultant posed no threat to their interests.

"The resource allocation is unprecedented," one executive murmured to another. "Three Haven sectors have had power reductions to fuel the first station."

"Worth it if it works," his companion replied. "Imagine controlling where storms hit. Which regions get rain. We'd have leverage over every remaining land government."

"Victor's been obsessed with this for years. Ever since Sophia's death."

Mira drifted to another conversation.

"The Tide Caller incidents are increasing," a security official was saying. "Three confirmed captures last month, but at least five escaped detection."

"They're organizing," another replied. "Intelligence suggests some kind of network operating through Tidefall."

"The new scanning technology should help. Can't hide altered DNA forever."

Mira moved on, her expression betraying nothing while her mind catalogued each piece of information. New scanning technology for Tide Callers. Power redirected from Haven sectors. Victor's personal investment in Project Watershed.

And Elian Reeves, the project's director, seemingly at odds with his father's vision.

As the gathering began to thin, Mira made her exit, passing once more through the security scanners without incident. The private transport reserved for visiting consultants waited to return her to the Haven docking station, where she would transfer to a Tide Dweller vessel back to Tidefall.

Once inside the transport, Mira allowed herself a moment to process what she'd learned. Project Watershed was far more advanced and ambitious than anyone in the resistance had realized. If Victor Reeves succeeded, Haven control over the post-flood world would be nearly absolute.

But she'd also discovered a potential weakness—or at least a complication—in Elian Reeves. His environmental concerns seemed genuine, his invitation to consult on the project unexpected. Was he truly at odds with his father's methods, or was this an elaborate security measure to identify threats?

Mira removed the pendant from around her neck, studying the small vial of Mediterranean water. It wasn't just a prop for her cover identity. The water inside had come from her childhood home, collected by her parents during their research. One of the few physical connections to her past that had survived the Deluge.

The water remembered. And now, having seen Victor Reeves in person, having stood in the heart of Haven power, Mira's resolve crystallized. She would stop Project Watershed, expose the corporations' role in the climate catastrophe, and make Victor Reeves answer for her parents' death.

And if Elian Reeves proved to be an ally rather than an obstacle... well, that was a complication she hadn't anticipated, but one she could potentially use.

The transport glided through Celestia Haven's gleaming towers, its route taking it past the Oceanic Solutions headquarters—a massive structure rising from the center of the floating city like a monument to corporate survival. Somewhere in that building were the secrets Mira had spent years trying to uncover.

And now, for the first time, she had a way in.
