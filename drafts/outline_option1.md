# Outline Option 1: Technological Integration Path

## Chapter 16: Discoveries Beneath
- Mira and Leila explore a submerged pre-Deluge research facility
- They discover a Class-5 biological containment unit still drawing power
- Haven military vessels attempt to secure the same facility
- Mira and Leila escape with the containment unit to the Voss Institute
- Chapter ends with Leila sensing "specialized water" inside the unit that feels "waiting"

## Chapter 17: Living Waters
- Analysis of the containment unit reveals genetically engineered microorganisms designed to repair damaged marine ecosystems
- The organisms respond uniquely to Tide Caller abilities, suggesting an intentional compatibility
- Evidence indicates the research was developed by Mira's parents but suppressed by Haven
- A Haven diplomatic delegation arrives at Tidefall demanding the return of "dangerous biological materials"
- Chapter ends with Elian warning Mira that Haven hardliners are mobilizing to seize the technology by force

## Chapter 18: Divided Currents
- The Adaptation Council debates how to respond to Haven's demands
- Mira works with Tide Callers to understand the connection between their abilities and the engineered organisms
- Victor Reeves provides crucial context about early Haven research into biological remediation
- A test demonstration shows the organisms can rapidly restore a small damaged reef when guided by Tide Callers
- Chapter ends with the detection of multiple Haven vessels approaching Tidefall under cover of a storm

## Chapter 19: Storm Surge
- Haven forces led by Admiral Caine (a hardliner opposed to the Harmony approach) attempt to seize the Voss Institute
- Tide Callers coordinate with Tidefall defenders to manipulate currents and visibility
- Elian confronts Caine, publicly rejecting Haven's militaristic approach
- The engineered organisms, responding to the heightened emotions of the Tide Callers, create unexpected patterns in the water
- Chapter ends with the Haven forces retreating after the organisms form a massive, glowing barrier around Tidefall

## Chapter 20: Harmony Realized
- The global community witnesses footage of the engineered organisms working with Tide Callers to defend Tidefall
- Victor Reeves publicly acknowledges that Haven suppressed this technology because it empowered distributed communities
- Mira establishes a training program integrating Tide Caller abilities with the engineered organisms
- The first major restoration project begins at the site of New Valencia
- Chapter ends with Mira diving at New Valencia, where new growth is beginning to emerge from the ruins, completing her journey from vengeance to creation
