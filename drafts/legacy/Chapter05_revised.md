# Chapter 5: The Meeting

Moonlight filtered through broken ceiling panels of the abandoned desalination plant, casting silver patterns across rusted machinery. Salt and decay permeated the air, remnants of forgotten technology lingering in the outskirts of Tidefall.

Mira arrived an hour early, scouting the perimeter and mapping three escape routes. The pendant of Mediterranean water rested cool against her collarbone as she positioned herself behind a support column at midnight, the main entrance in clear view. The facility's water pipes hummed at the edge of her awareness.

"You move like someone accustomed to being hunted."

The voice came from behind her. Mira spun, fingers finding the knife at her belt.

An elderly woman stood in a doorway that hadn't existed moments before—a section of wall, she realized, perfectly disguised. Silver hair pulled back in a severe bun framed a face etched with years but unmarked by frailty. Her eyes assessed Mira with undiminished precision.

"Dr. Sophia Reeves," Mira said, forcing her hand away from the weapon.

The woman inclined her head. "And you're Mira Voss. Elena and David's daughter." Her gaze softened. "You have your mother's eyes."

The casual mention of her parents' names sent a jolt through Mira's chest. 

"Dr. Reyes said you have evidence," Mira kept her voice level despite the current beneath. "About New Valencia. About my parents."

"I have evidence about many things." Sophia gestured toward the hidden doorway. "Security drones have increased their patrol patterns recently."

Mira hesitated, caution battling against the pull of answers.

"How do I know this isn't a trap?"

A ghost of a smile crossed Sophia's face. "Your mother asked the same thing when we first met." She withdrew a small object from her pocket, offering it on her palm.

A weathered university ID badge. Elena Voss, Marine Biology Department. The photo showed Mira's mother smiling with the certainty of someone who believed science could save the world.

"She gave me this the day before the evacuation," Sophia said. "For safekeeping, she said."

Mira's fingers trembled as they brushed against the laminated surface, worn smooth from handling. Had Sophia carried this piece of her mother for twenty years?

"Come," Sophia turned toward the hidden door. "Time has never been our ally."

The passage led to a small living space carved from the plant's former control room. Screens lined one wall displaying data feeds and security camera views. A modest sleeping area occupied one corner, a workstation another.

"You've been hiding here? In Tidefall?" Mira took in the surroundings.

"Not continuously," Sophia moved to a console, entering a sequence. "I maintain several locations throughout what remains of the Pacific Rim. This one serves current purposes."

The largest screen flickered to life, displaying ocean current patterns similar to those Victor Reeves had shown during the Haven gathering.

"Project Watershed," Mira said.

Sophia's mouth tightened. "Victor's attempt to play god with what remains of our world." She zoomed in on the North Pacific installation. "But you came for answers about the past, not warnings about the future."

She lowered herself into a chair, gesturing for Mira to do the same. For a moment, her composed facade cracked, revealing something underneath.

"I met your parents in 2095, during the early Acceleration phase. The Sofia Institute needed field data to refine our catastrophic sea level projections. Elena and David continued their research as the waters rose."

"The Sofia Institute—your name."

A nod. "My life's work, before Victor destroyed it." Bitterness edged her voice. "We were close, once. He funded the Institute's early research, championed our findings." Her fingers traced an invisible pattern on the table. "Until the projections threatened corporate interests."

"What changed him?"

"Power. Money. Perhaps fear." Sophia's gaze drifted. "Our models predicted not just environmental collapse but societal upheaval. The corporations that had profited from climate destruction would face accountability. Victor chose self-preservation."

She tapped a command, bringing up a document on screen. "This suppression order he issued in 2063 began the end for the Sofia Institute."

Mira recognized it immediately—the same memo from Dr. Reyes's office. Confirmation that Victor Reeves had personally ordered the destruction of climate research that might have prevented the worst of the Deluge.

"By 2097, the Acceleration had surpassed even our most pessimistic models," Sophia continued. "Your parents coordinated the scientific response in New Valencia."

Her voice dropped. "What you may not know is that New Valencia housed evidence of corporate climate crimes—including Oceanic Solutions' early weather modification experiments."

"The precursor to Project Watershed," Mira said, connections forming.

"Yes. Victor couldn't allow that research to reach the public." Sophia's eyes met Mira's. "He ordered Oceanic Solutions security to prevent 'unauthorized evacuations' from the New Valencia region."

She displayed another document—a security directive bearing Victor's signature and authorization code.

"They disabled the evacuation vessels' navigation systems," Sophia said. "When the sea wall failed ahead of schedule, the ships were trapped in the harbor. Twenty-three vessels. Over four thousand people."

Including her parents. Something molten formed in Mira's chest, grief and rage fusing together. "They murdered them to protect corporate secrets."

"Yes." 

"And you've been gathering evidence since then," Mira said. "Why not release it? Why hide for twenty years?"

Calculation flickered behind Sophia's grief. "Evidence without leverage is just history. The Haven corporations control information flow. They would discredit any accusations, bury any evidence." Her hand clenched. "I needed something more. A way to force accountability."

"Project Watershed," Mira realized. "You've been monitoring Victor's work."

"For years." Sophia stood, moving to the display. "The project itself is based partly on my research—twisted and weaponized. Victor believes he's creating a system to control ocean currents, to manage what remains of our world."

Her finger traced the installation points on the map. "What he doesn't know is that the system is fundamentally flawed. The energy requirements alone make it unsustainable, but more critically, the current manipulations will create cascading instabilities in global weather patterns."

"You're saying it won't work?"

"It will work," Sophia's voice hardened. "For a time. Long enough for Haven to consolidate control over remaining resources. But within five years, the system will begin to fail. The resulting current disruptions would trigger hyperstorms beyond anything we've seen since the Deluge."

Mira absorbed this, the scale staggering. "Another catastrophe, with Haven controlling who survives."

"Precisely." Determination burned in Sophia's eyes. "We must stop it before the network is complete. The North Pacific installation is operational but isolated. If we can access its control systems, we can demonstrate the fatal flaws while simultaneously releasing evidence of past climate crimes."

"We?" Mira asked.

"I've built a network. People who remember the truth, who have skills and access." Sophia studied Mira with new intensity. "Your abilities as a Tide Caller would be invaluable. The installation is underwater, guarded against conventional approaches."

Mira touched her pendant. "You knew what I am."

"Your mother told me, before the end. She was proud of you. Saw your connection to water as evolution, not aberration." Sophia's voice softened. "She believed Tide Callers represented humanity's adaptation to the world we created."

The knowledge of her mother's acceptance eased something in Mira's chest.

"There's something else you should know," Sophia said. "About Elian."

"Your son." Mira kept her expression neutral despite her quickening pulse.

"He doesn't know I'm alive." Pain crossed Sophia's face. "I've watched him from afar, seen him question his father's methods. He's positioned himself as Project Director to moderate Victor's ambitions, but he doesn't understand the fundamental flaws."

"You want to recruit him too," Mira said.

"He has access we need. Knowledge of the system architecture." Sophia's gaze held steady. "And he deserves to know the truth about his father. About me."

Mira recalled her encounter with Elian at the Haven gathering. His environmental concerns had seemed genuine, his invitation unexpected.

"I met him," she admitted. "At a Haven gathering. He invited me to consult on Project Watershed's environmental impact assessments."

Surprise flashed across Sophia's face, quickly replaced by calculation. "That's... unexpected. And potentially valuable." She studied Mira with new interest. "What impression did you form of him?"

"Conflicted," Mira said. "Intelligent. Possibly genuine in his environmental concerns. But still his father's son."

"Not entirely," Sophia murmured. "Not where it matters most." She straightened. "This changes our approach. Your connection to Elian provides an entry point we didn't have before."

"You want me to use him," Mira stated.

"I want you to give him a chance to choose the right side of history." Sophia's voice hardened. "The same chance I never gave his father."

The implications hung between them—personal revenge versus global stakes, past wrongs versus future catastrophe.

"What exactly are you proposing?" Mira asked.

"Accept his invitation. Gain his trust. Assess whether he can join our effort." Sophia's expression remained unyielding. "If he can, we'll proceed with his help. If not, we have alternatives."

Mira weighed this against her years of planning. Her goal had always been Victor Reeves's downfall, justice for her parents and countless others. Sophia offered a path to that justice, but one that involved Elian Reeves in ways Mira hadn't anticipated.

"And if I refuse?"

"Then we proceed without you," Sophia said. "But with less chance of success, and greater risk to those involved."

The weight of decision pressed on Mira. Her parents' faces flashed in her memory—not from photographs, but from her last sight of them, determined and afraid as they helped others onto evacuation vessels that would never escape the harbor.

"I'll do it," she said. "But I need to know everything—about Project Watershed, about Victor's security, about your network."

Relief flickered across Sophia's face. "We begin immediately." She activated another screen. "First, you should understand what we're facing."

As Sophia outlined Project Watershed's architecture and vulnerabilities, Mira felt her purpose shifting. For years, she'd focused on exposing the truth about the past. Now she faced a choice between vengeance for what had been lost and protection of what remained.

The water remembered. But perhaps it was time to focus on the future it would shape.
