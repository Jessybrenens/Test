# Chapter 6: The Consultation

Elian Reeves stood at the observation deck of the North Pacific modulation station, watching technicians in pressure suits make final adjustments to the external array. Through the reinforced viewport, the ocean stretched dark and vast, illuminated only by the station's external lights. At this depth—nearly three kilometers below the surface—the pressure would crush an unprotected human instantly.

The facility represented the culmination of decades of research and development. A marvel of engineering that his father called humanity's redemption. Elian saw it differently—as either salvation or catastrophe, balanced on a knife's edge of variables they couldn't fully control.

"Simulation results from the latest test sequence, sir."

Elian turned to find Dr. Nakamura, the station's lead scientist, offering a data tablet. Her expression was carefully neutral, but the tightness around her eyes suggested concern.

"Thank you, Mei." He accepted the tablet, scanning the figures with growing unease. The energy consumption had exceeded projections by seventeen percent. The current deflection patterns showed increasing instability at the outer boundaries. Small deviations now, but the trend line pointed toward significant disruptions if scaled to a global network.

Exactly as he'd feared.

"Have you shared these with my father?" Elian asked, keeping his voice casual despite the tension building in his chest.

"Not yet. I wanted your assessment first." Mei glanced toward the two security officers positioned near the deck entrance, their Haven corporate insignia identifying them as part of his father's personal detail rather than regular station security. "The results are... open to interpretation."

Meaning she understood the political implications as well as the scientific ones. Elian appreciated her discretion. In the three years they'd worked together on Project Watershed, Mei had proven herself not just brilliant but trustworthy—a rare combination in Haven's corporate environment.

"Let's discuss this in my office," he said, gesturing toward the corridor.

Once inside the privacy of his workspace, Elian activated the signal dampener built into his desk—officially for protecting proprietary research, unofficially for conversations exactly like this one. The soft hum provided cover for words that couldn't be overheard.

"The boundary instabilities are worsening," he said without preamble. "If we expand to a three-station network as planned—"

"The cascading effects could trigger hyperstorm formation in the convergence zones," Mei finished, dropping her professional reserve. "I've run the models seven different ways. The results vary in timing and intensity, but the outcome remains consistent."

Elian rubbed his temples, where a headache had been building since morning. "We need more data on the deep current interactions. The models are only as good as their inputs."

"Which is why your oceanographer consultant is so timely," Mei said, a hint of curiosity in her voice. "Dr. Voss, correct? I reviewed her credentials. Impressive field experience with post-flood adaptation patterns."

"Yes." Elian kept his expression neutral, though the mention of Mira sent an unexpected ripple of anticipation through him. "She's joining us tomorrow for the preliminary assessment. Her perspective might help us identify what we're missing."

If she was what she appeared to be. The background check had verified her professional credentials, but something about Dr. Marina Voss—Mira—had triggered his instincts during their conversation at the Haven gathering. A perception sharpened by years of navigating corporate politics and hidden agendas. She'd seemed too perceptive, too immediately focused on the project's environmental implications.

Either she was exceptionally good at her job, or she had motivations beyond professional interest. Possibly both.

"I'll prepare the environmental impact data for her review," Mei said, interrupting his thoughts. "Though I should warn you—the preliminary findings won't support your father's timeline for expansion."

"I'm counting on that," Elian replied. "We need solid scientific grounds to delay the Atlantic and Indian Ocean installations until we resolve these stability issues."

Mei studied him, her analytical mind clearly assessing more than just the technical problem. "Your father isn't known for his patience with delays."

"No," Elian agreed, the word heavy with unspoken history. "But even he can't argue with physics. Not successfully, anyway."

A chime from his communication unit interrupted them—a priority alert from Haven. Elian checked the message, his expression darkening.

"My father has moved up the project review. He'll be arriving at the station tomorrow morning." He looked up at Mei. "The same day as Dr. Voss."

"That's... not ideal timing," Mei said carefully.

"No, it's not." Elian's mind raced through implications and contingencies. "Prepare two versions of the simulation results. The complete analysis for me, and a... selectively edited version for the official presentation."

Mei's eyebrows rose slightly. "Selectively edited?"

"Nothing falsified," Elian clarified. "Just emphasizing the successful aspects while contextualizing the concerns as routine optimization challenges."

It wasn't the first time he'd managed information flow to his father. A necessary tactic when dealing with a man who saw obstacles as personal affronts rather than technical realities. But with the stakes of Project Watershed, the familiar strategy felt increasingly inadequate.

"I understand," Mei said, though her expression suggested she had reservations. "And Dr. Voss?"

"I'll handle that introduction carefully." Elian stood, signaling the end of their conversation. "In the meantime, continue the boundary stability tests. Document everything meticulously."

After Mei left, Elian remained in his office, staring at the simulation results. The numbers confirmed what he'd suspected since the project's inception—his father's vision of controlling ocean currents was fundamentally flawed. Not in concept, but in execution and, more critically, in purpose.

Victor Reeves saw Project Watershed as the ultimate expression of Haven dominance—technology that would cement corporate control over what remained of human civilization. Elian had positioned himself as project director to moderate that vision, to ensure the technology served recovery rather than control.

But moderation might not be enough. Not if the boundary instabilities continued to worsen. Not if the system itself was inherently unstable at scale.

He accessed his private terminal, navigating to the file containing Dr. Voss's credentials and background. Her research on post-flood marine ecosystems was legitimate and well-regarded within academic circles. Her connection to Tidefall University gave her access to data outside Haven's usual information channels.

What the file didn't explain was the intensity he'd glimpsed in her eyes when discussing environmental impact, or the way she'd touched the water pendant at her neck when speaking of the flood's consequences. There was something personal in her interest—something the background check hadn't captured.

Elian closed the file, decision made. He would proceed with the consultation as planned, but with heightened awareness. Dr. Voss might be exactly what the project needed—an external perspective unconstrained by Haven politics. Or she might represent something else entirely.

Either way, her arrival coinciding with his father's complicated an already precarious situation.

He deactivated the signal dampener and left his office, heading toward his private quarters. The station's layout mimicked Haven architecture—efficiency masked by luxury, at least for those of appropriate rank. His rooms were spacious by underwater facility standards, with programmable wall screens currently displaying a forest scene from one of the few remaining old-growth preserves.

Elian accessed his secure communication device—one unknown to Haven security or his father's surveillance. The connection took longer than usual, the signal having to penetrate three kilometers of ocean before reaching the nearest relay.

"Dr. Chen," he said when the connection finally established. "I need to accelerate our timeline. My father arrives tomorrow."

"That's problematic," the elderly archivist replied, his voice crackling through the encrypted channel. "The analysis of those Sofia Institute fragments isn't complete."

"Do what you can. And there's something else—a consultant named Dr. Marina Voss is joining the project tomorrow. Oceanographic specialist from Tidefall."

A pause, longer than the transmission delay would explain.

"Voss," Dr. Chen repeated carefully. "Interesting coincidence."

"Is it?" Elian asked, his suspicions sharpening. "Should I know that name?"

Another pause. "There were scientists named Voss among those lost in the New Valencia incident. Prominent climate researchers."

The New Valencia incident. One of the worst evacuation failures during the Acceleration phase. Thousands lost when sea walls failed ahead of schedule. The official record blamed inadequate engineering and unexpected storm surge. Elian had always suspected there was more to the story.

"Relation?"

"Possibly. I'll look into it." Dr. Chen's voice lowered further. "Be careful, Elian. If your father is accelerating his timeline, something has changed in the larger strategy."

"I know. Keep our people on alert." Elian ended the transmission and secured the device in its hidden compartment.

The coincidence—if it was coincidence—of Dr. Voss's consultation and his father's sudden visit left him uneasy. Victor Reeves didn't make impulsive schedule changes. Every movement was calculated, every interaction choreographed for maximum advantage.

Elian moved to the viewport in his quarters, staring out at the crushing darkness beyond. The ocean's pressure surrounded the station, constant and unforgiving. One structural failure, one critical error, and everything would be obliterated in an instant.

An apt metaphor for his position. Balancing between his father's ambitions and his own conscience. Between Haven privilege and global responsibility. Between the power to reshape the world and the wisdom to question whether they should.

Tomorrow would bring Dr. Voss, with her pointed questions and water pendant. Tomorrow would bring his father, with his implacable will and corporate agenda.

And Elian would stand between them, navigating currents as dangerous as any in the ocean beyond.
