# Chapter 12: The Reunion

Sophia Reeves pressed her palm against the cold metal of the underwater access hatch, feeling the vibrations of the station through her fingertips. Nineteen years of hiding, of watching from the shadows as her husband twisted her research into something monstrous. Nineteen years since she'd seen her son.

The submersible that had brought her here rested twenty meters below, camouflaged against the ocean floor by adaptive plating. Her team had positioned it precisely at the junction of maintenance conduits 37-B and 42-C—a blind spot in the station's external sensor array that she herself had identified during the original design phase.

"Breach team reports communications disruption successful," Kai's voice came through her earpiece, distorted by the deep-water transmission protocols. "Station comms are experiencing cascading failures across all secure channels. They're switching to emergency systems now."

Sophia adjusted her rebreather mask, the familiar weight of it against her face a reminder of countless dives in waters that had once been coastlines. "Duration?"

"Forty minutes before their redundancies can compensate. Maybe less if they've upgraded the quantum encryption."

"Enough time." She turned to the three figures floating beside her, their specialized dive suits marking them as fellow members of the resistance. "Remember, non-lethal interventions only. These are technicians and scientists, not soldiers."

The tallest of them, a woman with intricate braids visible beneath her helmet, nodded. "We're clear on the objectives. Get you to the central hub, extract Elian Reeves, secure the modulation controls."

Sophia activated the bypass sequence on her wrist terminal, watching as the ancient access codes—maintenance overrides from the station's initial construction—attempted to penetrate the security system. For several seconds, nothing happened. Then the hatch's indicator light shifted from red to amber.

"They've changed some of the protocols," she murmured, fingers dancing across the interface as she adapted her approach. "But not the underlying architecture."

The light flashed green. The hatch unsealed with a soft hiss of equalizing pressure.

"We're in."

The maintenance shaft beyond the hatch was dimly lit by emergency lighting strips, their blue glow reflecting off the moisture-slick walls. Sophia moved with practiced efficiency, her body remembering the layout of a station she had helped design two decades earlier. The others followed, their movements precise and economical.

"Security alert in progress," Kai updated through the comm. "They're reporting multiple system failures across environmental controls and communications. Security teams are spread thin."

"Victor's work," Sophia replied, a hint of grim satisfaction in her voice. "He never could resist overreacting."

They reached the first junction, where the maintenance shaft intersected with a larger service corridor. Sophia paused, consulting the station schematic displayed on her wrist terminal. The detention level would be two sections forward, one level up.

"Elian's location?"

"Still processing," Kai responded. "Internal tracking systems are in flux. Last confirmed position was Maintenance Level 3, Section 17."

Sophia frowned. Not the executive level where she'd expected Victor to hold him, but a peripheral area near the external maintenance bays. Either Victor was being unusually cautious, or something else was happening.

"Change of plan," she decided. "We head for Maintenance Level 3 first."

The team adjusted their route, moving through the service corridors with the confidence of those who had studied the station's layout for months. Occasionally they passed station personnel hurrying to address the cascading system failures, but in their maintenance coveralls and with the station in emergency status, the team attracted little attention.

Sophia felt the familiar tension building in her chest—not quite fear, but the heightened awareness that had kept her alive since she'd discovered Victor's true plans for Project Watershed. The pendant at her throat, containing a sample of water from her childhood home in Greece—now hundreds of meters underwater—seemed to pulse against her skin.

They reached the access point for Maintenance Level 3 without incident. The security panel beside the door showed active lockdown protocols—no entry without executive authorization.

"Kai, we need override access to Maintenance Level 3."

"Working on it. Their security systems are fighting back. Someone good is running countermeasures."

Sophia's lips curved in a slight smile. "That would be Dr. Nakamura. She always was brilliant with adaptive systems."

She removed a small device from her equipment belt—a specialized interface designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Haven security architecture. As she connected it to the panel, the screen flickered, lines of code scrolling rapidly as the device engaged with the security system.

"Tell me about the station status," she requested, eyes fixed on the changing display.

"Environmental systems showing instability in the modulation control sectors," Kai reported. "Power fluctuations in the primary reactor. They've initiated containment protocols in three sections due to pressure anomalies."

Exactly as predicted. The modulation technology was inherently unstable at this scale, creating harmonic resonances that the station's systems couldn't properly compensate for. Victor had ignored her warnings about this nineteen years ago. Now the evidence was manifesting.

The security panel beeped, its display shifting from red to green. The door slid open.

"We're through," Sophia announced, disconnecting her device. "Proceed with caution. If security is concentrated anywhere, it will be here."

The corridor beyond was eerily quiet, the usual background hum of station operations replaced by the intermittent wail of alert sirens. Emergency lighting cast everything in a pulsing blue glow, creating moving shadows that seemed to dance along the walls.

Sophia consulted her wrist terminal, which displayed a thermal mapping of the level based on environmental sensor data Kai had accessed. A cluster of heat signatures appeared in Section 17—multiple individuals in what appeared to be a maintenance control room.

"Six people, approximately thirty meters ahead," she informed her team. "Four showing security thermal patterns, two civilians."

"Elian?" asked the woman with braided hair.

"Possibly." Sophia adjusted her equipment belt, ensuring her non-lethal deterrents were easily accessible. "We proceed with caution. Kai, can you access the security feeds for this section?"

"Negative. They've isolated the surveillance systems. Running on closed circuit."

Smart. Someone was thinking defensively, limiting digital access points. That suggested they were protecting something—or someone—valuable.

They moved forward, approaching the heat signatures with practiced stealth. As they neared the maintenance control room, voices became audible—tense, argumentative.

"—cannot hold him indefinitely without formal charges," a woman was saying, her tone professionally firm despite obvious stress. "The Project Director has authority that supersedes even security protocols."

"My orders come directly from Victor Reeves," a male voice responded, the clipped precision marking him as security personnel. "Director Elian Reeves is to remain in protective custody until his father returns to the station."

"Protective custody?" A new voice, younger, with controlled anger beneath the words. "Is that what we're calling it now, Chief Larson?"

Sophia's heart contracted painfully in her chest. Elian. Her son's voice, so similar to how Victor's had sounded when they first met, but with an undertone of something Victor had never possessed—genuine moral outrage.

She signaled to her team, indicating positions around the control room entrance. They moved silently into place, readying their non-lethal deterrents.

"Three," she mouthed silently. "Two. One."

They moved as a coordinated unit, entering the control room from multiple access points simultaneously. The security personnel reacted with professional speed, reaching for weapons, but the team's shock deterrents activated first—targeted electromagnetic pulses that temporarily disrupted neural pathways without causing permanent damage.

The four security officers collapsed, their muscles temporarily unresponsive. The two civilians—a woman in a scientist's uniform and a man in the distinctive attire of a Project Director—remained standing, shock evident on their faces.

Sophia stepped forward, removing her rebreather mask.

For a moment, time seemed suspended. She looked at her son—taller than she remembered, his features sharpened into adulthood, but with her eyes looking back at her from Victor's face.

"Hello, Elian," she said softly.

He stared at her, disbelief warring with recognition. "It's not possible," he whispered. "You died. The accident at the Sofia Institute—"

"There was no accident." Sophia moved closer, fighting the urge to reach for him. "I discovered what your father was planning. What he'd done at New Valencia. I had to disappear to gather evidence, to build a resistance that could stop him."

Elian's expression shifted through confusion, shock, anger, and finally settled into something more complex—a painful mixture of hope and betrayal.

"Nineteen years," he said, his voice barely audible. "You let me believe you were dead for nineteen years."

The woman beside him—Dr. Nakamura, Sophia realized, recognizing her former student despite the years—placed a steadying hand on Elian's arm.

"Director Reeves," she said quietly, "the modulation field instabilities are increasing. We need to make a decision about emergency protocols."

Elian didn't look away from Sophia's face. "You're working with Mira Voss."

It wasn't a question. Sophia nodded. "She should have reached the rendezvous point by now. The data you helped her extract will be enough to stop the Atlantic installation."

"If there's still time," Dr. Nakamura interjected. "The instabilities in this station's modulation field are accelerating beyond predicted parameters. The system is approaching cascade failure."

As if to emphasize her point, the station shuddered, a deep vibration that seemed to emanate from its very core. The lights flickered, emergency systems momentarily faltering.

"We need to reach the central control hub," Sophia said. "I can implement emergency shutdown protocols for the modulation field."

"Those protocols were removed from the system," Elian replied, his professional focus reasserting itself despite the emotional turmoil. "Father had them deleted after the last stability test showed potential vulnerabilities."

Of course he had. Victor had always been pathologically averse to admitting failure, to the point of removing safety measures that might suggest his projects were anything less than perfect.

"Then we create new ones," Sophia decided. "Dr. Nakamura, you've been monitoring the field instabilities. With your data and my knowledge of the original system architecture, we can develop an emergency shutdown sequence."

Another tremor ran through the station, stronger this time. Warning lights flashed on the control room displays, indicating pressure anomalies in multiple sections.

"We don't have much time," Dr. Nakamura warned. "The modulation field is creating harmonic resonances in the surrounding ocean currents. If it collapses completely—"

"The resulting pressure wave could rupture the station's structural integrity," Sophia finished. "I know."

Elian looked between them, then made a decision. "Central control hub. Now." He turned to the woman with braided hair. "Can your team secure our path?"

"Already mapping the route," she confirmed, checking her wrist terminal. "Security forces are concentrated in the upper levels. We can use maintenance conduits to avoid most of them."

Sophia felt a surge of pride at her son's decisive leadership, even as grief twisted inside her at all the years she'd missed. There would be time for explanations later—if they survived the next few hours.

"Let's move," she said.

They exited the control room, leaving the incapacitated security personnel behind. The station's tremors were becoming more frequent, the environmental systems struggling to compensate for the modulation field's increasing instability.

As they navigated through the maintenance conduits, Sophia found herself beside Elian, close enough to see the tension in his jaw, the controlled precision of his movements that reminded her painfully of herself.

"The woman who escaped—Mira Voss," he said quietly, his voice pitched for her ears alone. "She's a Tide Caller."

Sophia nodded. "One of the most powerful we've found. Her connection to water goes beyond the abilities most Tide Callers develop."

"And you've been working with them all this time? Building a resistance?"

"Someone had to preserve the truth," Sophia replied. "About the Deluge, about New Valencia, about what corporations like Oceanic Solutions did to the world. Your father has been systematically erasing that history, replacing it with a narrative that positions Haven as humanity's savior rather than part of what caused the catastrophe."

Elian's expression tightened. "I've seen the evidence. The historical revisionism in Haven educational materials. The suppression of climate crime investigations." He paused. "I've been investigating him for years."

Now it was Sophia's turn to feel shock. "You have?"

"Did you think I would blindly follow in his footsteps?" A flash of anger crossed his face. "I'm not a child anymore, Mother. I've seen what Haven has become under leaders like him. I joined Project Watershed to change it from within, to redirect its purpose toward actual environmental restoration rather than control."

Before Sophia could respond, the station lurched violently, throwing them against the conduit wall. Warning sirens blared, their pitch changing to indicate a higher level of emergency.

"Structural integrity compromised in Sections 22 through 27," announced the station's automated system. "All personnel evacuate to designated safety zones. This is not a drill."

"We need to hurry," Dr. Nakamura urged, checking readings on her portable terminal. "The modulation field harmonics are approaching critical resonance."

They increased their pace, moving through the conduits with greater urgency. Sophia noticed Elian consulting his own terminal frequently, his expression growing increasingly concerned.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Father's shuttle departed from Celestia Haven forty minutes ago," he replied. "He's returning to the station."

Sophia felt cold certainty settle in her stomach. "He knows."

"He must have been alerted when the security systems detected unauthorized access to his files." Elian's voice was grim. "He'll be here within the hour."

Another violent tremor shook the station, this one lasting several seconds. Lights flickered, and for a moment the artificial gravity seemed to fluctuate, creating a momentary sensation of weightlessness before stabilizing.

"We may not have an hour," Dr. Nakamura warned. "The modulation field is destabilizing exponentially now."

They reached the access point for the central control hub, only to find it sealed with executive-level security protocols. Elian stepped forward, placing his palm against the biometric scanner.

"Director Elian Reeves, authorization Watershed-Alpha-Seven-Nine."

The scanner processed his biometrics, then flashed red. "Access denied. Security protocol Omega in effect."

Elian's expression hardened. "He's locked me out of the system."

"Can we bypass it?" asked the woman with braided hair.

Sophia was already connecting her specialized interface to the security panel. "Yes, but it will take time we don't have." She looked at Dr. Nakamura. "Is there another way into the control hub?"

The scientist considered for a moment, then nodded. "The environmental maintenance access. It bypasses the main security systems, but it's only designed for emergency repair access. It will be physically challenging."

"Show us," Sophia decided.

Dr. Nakamura led them to a narrow access panel near the floor, almost hidden behind a section of wall paneling. "This leads directly to the environmental control systems behind the main hub. The passage is narrow and partially flooded due to condensation from the cooling systems."

Sophia nodded to her team. "Secure this position. If Victor arrives, delay him by any non-lethal means necessary." She turned to Elian and Dr. Nakamura. "We'll proceed through the maintenance access."

The passage beyond the panel was as challenging as Dr. Nakamura had warned—a narrow tunnel barely wide enough for an adult to crawl through, with several centimeters of water covering its floor. They proceeded single file, Dr. Nakamura leading, followed by Elian, with Sophia bringing up the rear.

The station's tremors felt more pronounced in the confined space, the metal walls vibrating around them as the modulation field's instability continued to grow. Through the water beneath them, Sophia could feel the harmonics building—dangerous patterns that threatened the station's structural integrity.

"Almost there," Dr. Nakamura called back. "The access panel to the control hub should be just ahead."

As they reached the panel, another violent tremor shook the station. Warning lights flashed in the tunnel, and the automated system announced: "Critical failure in modulation field containment. Emergency protocols initiated. All personnel proceed to evacuation points immediately."

Dr. Nakamura worked quickly to open the access panel, her fingers dancing across the manual release mechanisms. With a hiss of equalizing pressure, the panel swung open, revealing the environmental control section of the central hub beyond.

They climbed out of the tunnel into a space dominated by massive cooling units and atmospheric processors. Through a transparent partition, they could see the main control area of the hub—and the figure standing at the central console, his back to them.

Victor Reeves.

Sophia felt her breath catch. After nineteen years, her husband stood less than twenty meters away, his posture as commanding as ever as he worked at the control systems.

"He's overriding the emergency protocols," Dr. Nakamura whispered, watching his actions on the console. "He's trying to force the modulation field to stabilize by increasing power to the containment systems."

"That will only accelerate the harmonic resonance," Sophia replied, horror growing as she recognized what he was doing. "He's going to trigger a catastrophic collapse."

Elian moved toward the partition door, determination hardening his features. "I need to stop him."

"Elian, wait—" Sophia began, but he was already activating the door release.

The partition slid open. Victor turned, alerted by the sound.

For a moment, father and son stared at each other across the control hub. Then Victor's gaze shifted, moving past Elian to where Sophia stood.

His expression transformed—shock, disbelief, and something more complex washing across features that had aged but remained recognizable to her. For an instant, she glimpsed the man she had once loved, brilliant and passionate about saving a drowning world.

Then his face hardened into the mask she had come to fear—the corporate executive who had sacrificed thousands at New Valencia to protect Haven's interests.

"Sophia," he said, her name sounding strange in his voice after so many years. "I should have known you were behind this."

"Victor." She stepped forward, moving to stand beside her son. "You need to shut down the modulation field. The harmonics are approaching critical resonance."

"Always the cautious scientist," he replied, a familiar dismissiveness in his tone. "The field can be stabilized with sufficient power. I've made the necessary adjustments."

As if in direct contradiction to his words, the station shuddered violently, warning lights flashing across every console in the control hub.

"Warning: Modulation field containment at seventeen percent and falling," announced the automated system. "Catastrophic failure imminent."

Dr. Nakamura moved to a secondary console, her fingers flying across the interface. "The harmonics are cascading through the entire system. We have minutes, perhaps less, before total collapse."

Victor's expression flickered with uncertainty for the first time. He turned back to his console, examining the readings with growing concern.

"This shouldn't be happening," he muttered. "The containment algorithms should be compensating."

"They can't," Sophia said, moving closer. "I tried to tell you nineteen years ago. The mathematics doesn't work at this scale. The ocean currents create feedback loops that amplify rather than dampen the harmonic resonances."

Another violent tremor shook the station, this one strong enough to throw them all off balance. Equipment crashed from shelves, and a ceiling panel collapsed nearby.

"Structural integrity at sixty-two percent," the automated system warned. "Evacuation order in effect for all personnel."

Elian stepped forward, addressing his father directly. "We need to initiate a complete shutdown. It's the only way to prevent catastrophic failure."

Victor hesitated, decades of corporate pride warring with the evidence before him. Then, reluctantly, he nodded. "The emergency shutdown was removed from the system. We'll need to create a new protocol."

"I can do it," Sophia said, moving to the main console. "Dr. Nakamura, I need your current harmonic readings. Elian, access the power distribution controls. We need to systematically reduce power to the modulation emitters in a specific sequence to avoid triggering a resonance cascade."

They worked with the focused intensity of scientists facing a deadly deadline, decades of distrust temporarily set aside in the face of immediate catastrophe. Sophia's fingers moved across the familiar systems—changed in their specifics but still based on her original designs.

"Power reduction sequence programmed," she announced after several tense minutes. "Beginning shutdown procedure."

On the massive display dominating the control hub wall, they could see a visualization of the modulation field surrounding the station—a complex, shifting pattern of energy that was visibly destabilizing, fracture lines spreading through its structure like cracks in glass.

"Initiating shutdown sequence," Sophia confirmed, activating the program she had created. "Phase one: reducing power to tertiary emitters."

The visualization showed the outer edges of the field beginning to dissipate, the energy patterns slowly fading. For a moment, it seemed to be working.

Then a new alarm sounded, its tone more urgent than any before.

"Warning: Harmonic resonance detected in primary containment systems. Catastrophic failure predicted in three minutes."

Dr. Nakamura's expression was grim as she checked her readings. "The shutdown sequence is too slow. The resonance is building faster than the field can dissipate."

Victor pushed forward, examining the console. "We need to accelerate the sequence."

"That could trigger the very cascade we're trying to prevent," Sophia objected.

"We don't have a choice," he insisted. "At the current rate, the field will collapse before the shutdown completes."

Another violent tremor emphasized his point, this one accompanied by the ominous sound of metal stress fractures somewhere deep in the station's structure.

"Structural integrity at forty-seven percent," the automated system announced. "Critical systems failure imminent."

Elian looked between his parents, then made a decision. "There's another option." He turned to Dr. Nakamura. "The Tide Caller frequency."

Her eyes widened. "The harmonic pattern we detected in Mira Voss's interaction with water systems."

"Exactly." Elian turned to Sophia. "Your resistance includes Tide Callers. They can manipulate water at a molecular level, creating harmonic patterns that might counteract the resonance."

"We have three Tide Callers on my team," Sophia confirmed, understanding dawning. "But they're not as powerful as Mira. I don't know if they can affect a field of this magnitude."

"They don't need to affect the entire field," Dr. Nakamura said, excitement breaking through her professional demeanor. "They just need to create a counter-resonance pattern in the water surrounding the primary emitters. That could stabilize the field long enough for the shutdown sequence to complete."

Victor was staring at them, confusion evident. "Tide Callers? The genetic aberrations from the Drowned territories?"

"Not aberrations," Sophia corrected sharply. "Adaptations. Humanity evolving to survive in a changed world—something Haven has been systematically suppressing because it threatens your control narrative."

Before Victor could respond, the station lurched violently, throwing them all against the nearest surfaces. Emergency lighting activated as the main power fluctuated.

"No time to argue," Elian snapped. "Mother, can your Tide Callers do this?"

Sophia nodded, already activating her communication device. "Kai, I need the Tide Caller team at the central hub immediately. Emergency protocol Omega."

"On their way," came the immediate response. "Ninety seconds."

Dr. Nakamura was already modifying the shutdown sequence, her fingers dancing across the interface. "I'm programming the counter-resonance pattern based on our observations of Tide Caller harmonics. They'll need to synchronize their abilities with this frequency."

The next two minutes passed in a blur of focused activity. The Tide Caller team arrived—three individuals in specialized dive suits that Sophia had designed to amplify their natural abilities. She briefed them quickly, Dr. Nakamura providing the specific harmonic frequency they needed to generate.

"Position yourselves around the primary emitter access points," Sophia instructed. "You'll need to maintain the counter-resonance pattern for approximately four minutes while the shutdown sequence completes."

As the Tide Callers moved into position, Victor watched with undisguised fascination. "You've been working with them all this time," he said to Sophia, his voice low. "Studying their abilities."

"Not studying," she corrected. "Collaborating. Learning from them. They understand water in ways our science is only beginning to comprehend."

The station shuddered again, the tremors now almost continuous. Warning systems blared from every console.

"They're in position," Kai reported through the comm system. "Ready to begin."

Sophia looked to Dr. Nakamura, who nodded confirmation. "Shutdown sequence modified and ready. Initiating on your mark."

"Begin," Sophia commanded.

The Tide Callers activated their abilities simultaneously, their specialized suits glowing with a soft blue luminescence as they engaged with the water systems surrounding the primary emitters. On the main display, new patterns appeared in the visualization—organized, rhythmic waves that began to intersect with the chaotic resonance of the failing modulation field.

"It's working," Dr. Nakamura reported, her voice tight with controlled excitement. "The harmonic disruption is decreasing. Field stability increasing to twenty-three percent."

"Shutdown sequence proceeding," Elian confirmed, monitoring his console. "Power reduction at thirty percent and continuing."

For several tense minutes, they watched as the two processes worked in tandem—the Tide Callers maintaining their counter-resonance pattern while the shutdown sequence gradually reduced power to the modulation field. The station's tremors began to decrease in both frequency and intensity.

"Field stability at forty-one percent," Dr. Nakamura reported. "Shutdown sequence at sixty percent completion."

Victor moved to stand beside Sophia, his expression complex as he watched the Tide Callers working. "I never imagined..." he began, then stopped. "All these years, I thought technology was the only answer."

"There are many answers," Sophia replied quietly. "Most of them require us to work with nature, not against it."

The main display showed the modulation field continuing to dissipate, its energy patterns becoming more organized as the Tide Callers' counter-resonance stabilized the remaining active sections.

"Shutdown sequence at eighty-five percent," Elian announced. "Field stability holding at fifty-seven percent."

The station gave one final, gentle shudder, then stabilized. The warning sirens ceased, replaced by the steady tone indicating emergency protocols in effect but immediate danger passed.

"Modulation field shutdown complete," the automated system announced. "Station stabilizing. Damage assessment in progress."

The Tide Callers maintained their positions for several more minutes, ensuring the last energy patterns dissipated safely, then gradually disengaged their abilities. The blue luminescence of their suits faded, returning to normal.

In the sudden quiet of the control hub, the four of them—Sophia, Victor, Elian, and Dr. Nakamura—stood in a moment of shared relief and uncertainty.

"The Atlantic installation," Elian said finally, breaking the silence. "It needs to be canceled immediately. The same instabilities would manifest there, possibly with even more catastrophic results due to the different current patterns."

Victor's face showed the conflict within him—the corporate leader who had invested years and immense resources in Project Watershed warring with the scientist who could not deny the evidence before him.

"The board won't accept this easily," he said. "They've committed too much to the project."

"They'll accept it when they see the data Mira extracted," Sophia replied. "Combined with what happened here today, it provides irrefutable evidence that the technology is fundamentally flawed at this scale."

Victor looked at her, really looked at her, for the first time since she'd entered the control hub. "Nineteen years," he said quietly. "You could have come to me. We could have worked together to fix the flaws."

"After New Valencia?" Sophia's voice hardened. "After you deliberately sabotaged the evacuation to protect Haven's interests? After you began systematically erasing the truth about corporate responsibility for the Deluge?" She shook her head. "You chose your path, Victor. I chose mine."

Elian looked between his parents, the weight of their shared and separate histories evident in his expression. "And now we choose a new path," he said firmly. "Together or separately, but forward."

The station's communication system suddenly activated, a priority signal cutting through the moment.

"North Pacific Station, this is Celestia Haven Command," came an authoritative voice. "We've detected critical system failures in your modulation field. Status report required immediately."

Victor hesitated, looking at the communication console, then at his wife and son. Nineteen years of corporate loyalty and personal ambition balanced against the undeniable evidence of technological failure and the unexpected reunion with the family he had thought lost.

"They're waiting for your response," Dr. Nakamura said quietly. "As Project Founder, you're the only one with the authority they'll accept without question."

Victor straightened his shoulders, the corporate mask settling back into place, but with something different behind it now—a hint of the scientist he had once been, capable of changing course when the evidence demanded it.

He activated the communication system. "Celestia Haven Command, this is Victor Reeves. Project Watershed is experiencing critical design flaws that necessitate immediate shutdown of all modulation field technology. I am issuing an executive order to suspend all further installations pending complete review."

There was a moment of stunned silence from the other end. Then: "Confirmed, Director Reeves. Awaiting your detailed report and recommendations."

As Victor continued providing technical details to Haven Command, Sophia found herself standing beside her son, watching the man she had once loved and then feared make the first step toward redemption.

"Do you think he means it?" Elian asked quietly. "Or is this just temporary damage control?"

Sophia studied Victor's face as he spoke—the familiar determination now tempered with something that looked almost like humility.

"I don't know," she admitted. "People can change when confronted with undeniable truth. Some do. Some don't."

"And the evidence Mira has? The climate crimes, New Valencia?"

"That's a separate battle," Sophia replied. "One step at a time."

The station's warning systems had fully subsided now, the automated damage control systems already beginning repairs to affected areas. Through the control hub's viewport, Sophia could see the ocean beyond—dark, powerful, patient. The water remembered what people forgot. And now, perhaps, people were beginning to remember too.

Elian's hand found hers, a tentative connection bridging nineteen years of absence. "We have a lot to talk about," he said.

Sophia nodded, feeling the weight of all the lost years between them. "Yes," she agreed. "We do."

As Victor finished his communication with Haven Command and turned back to face them, the station's systems issued a new alert—not a warning this time, but a notification.

"Incoming vessel detected at perimeter boundary," the automated system announced. "Identification: Salvage vessel 'Mnemosyne.' Request for emergency docking in progress."

Sophia smiled, recognizing the vessel name—the Greek goddess of memory, a fitting choice for their mission to preserve the truth.

"Mira," she said. "She's returned."

The reunion was complete. Now the real work could begin.
