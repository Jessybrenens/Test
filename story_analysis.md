## World-Building Elements

1. **Post-Flood World**: 75 meters of sea level rise has transformed Earth's geography, with three distinct social classes:
   - **Haven Elite**: Live in floating cities controlled by corporations
   - **Tide Dwellers**: Middle class who serve Haven interests
   - **Drowned**: Poorest survivors living in flooded settlements

2. **Tide Callers**: People with genetic adaptations allowing water manipulation, viewed with suspicion by Haven authorities.

3. **Project Watershed**: Technology to control ocean currents globally, with modulation stations being built in key locations.

4. **Tidefall**: Repurposed university structures forming a floating settlement, more independent from Haven control.

5. **Celestia Haven**: Primary floating city controlled by corporations, center of power and luxury.

## Themes

1. **Environmental Justice**: Corporate responsibility for climate catastrophe and the fight for accountability.

2. **Power vs. Responsibility**: The ethics of controlling natural systems and who benefits from such control.

3. **Truth and Memory**: "The water remembers what people forgot" - preserving historical truth against corporate revisionism.

4. **Adaptation vs. Control**: Different approaches to surviving in a changed world - working with nature vs. dominating it.

5. **Personal Vengeance vs. Collective Good**: Mira's evolution from seeking revenge to preventing future harm.

## Narrative Tension Points
